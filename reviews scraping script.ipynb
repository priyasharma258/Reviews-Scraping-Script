Just search \"Tripadvisor reputation\" and you\\'ll see the truth for yourself.If every customer were obligated to leave a review, Tripadvisor wouldn\\'t survive — the positive feedback would be so overwhelming that the \"hate machine\" you rely on would collapse overnight.We\\'ve received multiple \"Travelers\\' Choice Awards\" over the years, but we consciously choose not to display or advertise them. Why? Because in 2024 alone, we served 12,745 tables and received only 27 Tripadvisor reviews. Isn’t that shocking? Doesn\\'t that say everything about how irrelevant Tripadvisor has become — now mostly a channel for negativity?A very small percentage of satisfied customers ever bother to leave a review. Frustrated customers, on the other hand?

The itinerary described on your website clearly states:\"Start your journey with a refreshing swim in a cool pool, perfect for unwinding and recharging. Then, gear up for an exhilarating quad biking experience across the rugged terrain of the Atlas Mountains, complete with safety equipment and guidance from a professional instructor.\"After the quad biking, the description mentions a camel ride, which is fine. However, the actual sequence of events was entirely different:Quad biking – This was done first, under extremely high temperatures, making it uncomfortable.Camel ride – Again, in unbearable heat.Swimming pool – Instead of being the refreshing start to the experience, we were taken to the pool at the very end of the tour, just as the sun was setting. Not only was the timing completely impractical, but we were also not allowed to swim. Neither my partner nor the French family accompanying us were permitted to use the pool, despite it being a key part of the package. When we complained, the staff simply told us they \"couldn\\'t do anything about it.\" I have photographic evidence showing the time we arrived at the pool, confirming this issue.Additionally, when booking, we were given the option to choose between a French or English-speaking guide. We specifically selected English. However, neither the quad biking guides nor the camel ride guides spoke English. We had to rely on the French family to translate for us, which is completely unacceptable—especially when riding a quad bike in the desert, where clear instructions are crucial for safety.When I raised this complaint through TripAdvisor, I received the following response from Viator:\"We did not include in the description that the pool will be heated; it’s winter, so it’s typical for the water to be cold.\"At no point in my complaint did I say that the pool was cold or that I expected it to be heated. My issue was that we were not allowed to swim at all, despite it being part of the itinerary. This response completely ignores the actual complaint.After that, I received another response stating:\"As part of this review, we investigated all materials and pertinent information including (but not limited to) the product details on the tour page, your ticket, and any communications regarding this booking. Based on all available information, we regret to inform you that we are unable to issue a refund for this booking.\"This so-called investigation was done without even requesting the photo evidence I offered to provide. How can you claim to have reviewed all available information without even considering the proof I have?I expect a proper resolution to this issue. At the very least, I request a partial refund for the experience not being delivered as advertised. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter further.Looking forward to a prompt and reasonable response.Date of experience: February 14, 2025', 'date': 'March 01, 2025'}\n",

The service was excellent and amazing value for money and there was no attempt to exploit or scam customers.

The guest’s actions were reprehensible, and after the arrest, they continued to harass and threaten us. They then began targeting our business with malicious reviews.  Google quickly removed these reviews after investigating the situation and seeing the facts. However, Tripadvisor has not only refused to take down these defamatory reviews but has allowed this guest to call us \"criminal\" simply because we, along with an online travel agent, declined their request for a refund. Both we and the travel agent agree the guest isn’t entitled to one, given their violent behavior.  Shockingly, Tripadvisor has let this individual continue reviewing other establishments with the same name as ours, further harming our reputation. When we contacted Tripadvisor, their response was dismissive, claiming the guest is \"entitled to their opinion\" and can leave reviews for as many people in their party as they like. This is completely unacceptable and shows a blatant disregard for the truth and the rights of business owners under *UK Defamation Laws (Defamation Act 2013)*.  All we’ve received are automated responses from Tripadvisor, who seem to care more about promoting their paid schemes than addressing legitimate issues. It’s absurd that they expect businesses like ours to pay them for promotional services while allowing defamatory and false content to damage our reputation unchecked.  Tripadvisor needs to do better.

Highly likely this review would be the longest I have ever done.It is prepared at the hotel lobby with security & front-office staff present.The stay at the hotel would have been a superb experience if it would not had been utterly spoiled by an alleged fraudulent activity done by agents of Trip.com. (This Trip.com’s activity will be dealt with accordingly through authority channels once we are back in the resident country). I have been informed that said activities is done by Trip.com repeatedly and have been causing negative impressions.  To shed some light on; Trip.com charges customers for higher rate/better rooms.But in reality it actually reserved lower rate rooms.  So when customers showed up, they realised that rooms are not as expected.  (Put yourself in the shoes of someone who had been on a 18 hours flight {excluding transit time}, stepped into the room that much inferior to which they paid for and the reserved customer is a registered disabled individual!  Personally, I do not envy front-office staff trying to diffuse the situation.)Our case escalated.  We had to pay extra to get the actual room booked through Trip.com.  So basically it negatively impacted financially to us (Paying extra to the hotel for the already paid room through Trip.com.  It would had been cheaper and less stressful of course if the reservation was done directly through the hotel’s website.) even though it was not customers’ fault nor the hotel’s.  We had to accept the arrangement because it was not wise to relocate somewhere else at short notice.One can find out physical details of the hotel on its website so I decided not to elaborate.  I will focus on things someone can experience in person.  *Front-office staff - great service providers all around.*House-keeping staff - great service providers.*Security - do the job proper. * Restaurant staff - provided great meals and service.(*I observed and interacted personally with staff to make these conclusions.)Review would not be completed without negative inputs though.

Tripadvisor/Viator doesn’t recognise the issue with the tour guide not speaking english or that their app fails to mention there will be multiple guides, they also fail to recognise the reason I cancelled was due to Spanish tour guide and the Spanish wording in the tour app description which at that moment made me believe a mistake had been made on their end. The tour booking advises look for a \"tour guide\" with black umbrella however after speaking to their customer service team via email they later informed me there were multiple tour guides in the area with black umbrellas, their argument is I should have asked the Spanish tour guide, look the guy was speaking a different language and was engaged in a conversation with all the other Spanish speaking tourists, I don\\'t speak Spanish and as a paying customer don\\'t feel I needed to confront the guide, the app said look for the tour guide, we could only see one 1 with black umbrella so why would be dispute this? Perhaps the tour booking should have been clearer that there would be multiple guides in the area with black umbrellas and to find the one that speaks your language. The whole experience left me confused and my thought process was that something had gone wrong on their end. They now flat out refuse to provide me with a full refund.  I’m a valuable customer who has paid Viator over £300 on other tours during our stay in Edinburgh excluding this one but they prefer to hold onto small change and lose me forever and my future business.

This is a scam and Tripadvisor (which used to be very good) should not allow this as it just wastes peoples time and make them go to another site for info.  Sort this out!

The reviews were extremely negative and very damaging, as well as being offensive and perhaps defamatory to the hotel employees that were called out by name for specific criticism. I asked TripAdvisor to take the reviews down. They refused, saying that the reviews were 'in policy', even though they are not genuine. I then posted a management response to the reviews, warning readers that the reviews were not genuine. TripAdvisor refused to publish my response, on the grounds that I was claiming that the reviews were fraudulent, which is against their policy.So it is in TripAdvisor policy to post a fake/fraudulent review, but it is not in policy for the victim of a fake/fraudulent review to point this out.TripAdvisor has no long term future without trust.

This left our group scrambling for accommodation, with prices through the roof due to high demand. Despite this nightmare, TripAdvisor offered no compensation and did little to help us find a suitable alternative.This whole debacle has made it painfully clear that TripAdvisor and its affiliates have lousy vetting processes, leaving customers vulnerable to scams, with no real action taken to address the issue.

We only noticed the attempt to covertly get us to sign away our rights when they asked us to sign the \"voucher\", which made us suspicious and prompted us to read the following small print:\"This certificate is received as compensation for any inconveniences experienced during the recipient\\'s stay at our resort. This compensation is accepted by the guest with complete satisfaction and exempts The Excellence Collection and any other company related to the booking of your trip from all future claims or responsibilities. The recipient of this certificate agrees to not disclose the terms of this form of release, any statement, photo, or other information relating to the incident on social media. Failure to comply with this non-disclosure agreement will be deemed a breach of this settlement\".We considered this a very serious matter and raised it with the hotel after the stay but they were uninterested in taking any responsibility for this poor business practice, which is also directly in breach of Tripadvisor\\'s guidelines for hotels (i.e. manipulation of reviews by having guests sign confidentiality agreements to not post about negative experiences).Unfortunately, my review was wrongly taken down by Tripadvisor, despite not breaching any guidelines and it appears my entire account has now been flagged so any review I write is automatically removed. This means that the reviewing system is completely skewed. I also notified Tripadvisor of a practice at the hotel whereby employees pressure guests into scanning a QR code to give a 5 star review and mention the employee by name. Again, Tripadvisor doesn\\'t seem to care about this manipulative practice.When I have tried to contact Tripadvisor customer service, all I get is a copy and paste \"computer says no\" response and absolutely no inclination on Tripadvisor\\'s behalf to actually engage on these serious issues.Update following Tripadvisor response on 31 October: This is an identical copy and paste response to those already received from your customer services team and does not actually address the issues noted in the review. It also does nothing to address the points around managing manipulation by the hotel in question by silencing guests with negative experiences through routine use of NDAs which are disguised as free upgrade vouchers and through their practice of pressuring guests into leaving 5 star reviews by scanning QR codes while they are trying to enjoy their holiday.Date of experience: October 30, 2023', 'date': 'US'}\n",

Our holiday experience was enhanced due to two of the bar staff. Jason in the main pool bar area who we met when we first arrived and Pavlos who we met the following day in the lower pool bar. Both young men were very attentive to all of their guests and whilst being very professional with their cocktails and various coffees and other drinks, spent time with all of the guests and interacting with them which undoubtedly enhanced our experience and were sad when the time had come to leave. We also treat ourselves to a spa treatment across the road at the Castello boutique hotel organised by the lovely Maria will definitely be returning in the not too distant future. There is  some building work going on next door but this made no impact on our experience as we heard no noise and very limited dust.Alison and RichardDate of experience: July 10, 2023', 'date': '5 reviews'}\n",

The algorithm function is unreliable at identifying fake reviews and TA only has 300 agents to vet 7 million posts. Clearly, that\\'s not enough so fake reviews slip by on both sides of the fence. We went from an average of 15 bookings per month to 0 bookings from the end of April until July (we still have no bookings) because of the fakes. We hope that our business will recuperate from the damage. That remains to be seen.I advise any supplier who is being defamed by fake reviews follow all of TA\\'s procedures and consistently stay in contact. The thing that actually worked for me was this review on Trustpilot. Until I posted here I only got the run around.Following is my original review:My husband and I  are dependent on TripAdvisor reviews. We went from being a 5 star business over a period of 3 years to being completely shut down overnight by fake reviews created by a psychopath proven to be focused on destroying our business. After unsuccessfully using all of TripAdvisor\\'s suggested methods for reporting and removing fake reviews, we contacted TripAdvisor CEO Matt Goldberg directly, also to no avail. We sent him \"concise and informative\" documentation of all evidence of criminal behavior by this psychopath including proof of the FBI investigation, the restraining order and copies of social media threats to destroy our business as well as threats of violence by the perpetrator.We filled out and submitted TripAdvisor\\'s \"Content Integrity\" form. We showed that all of the fake i.d.\\'s created to allow the perpetrator to make fake reviews happened within a time period of less than 30 days. We even showed that during the month of May when the perpetrator claimed to have taken our tour - we had NO BOOKINGS!TripAdvisor has allowed the fake reviews to remain (6 fake reviews one directly after another - and counting) and removed our replies showing that the reviews were in question and being investigated by TripAdvisor.  After contacting Matt Goldberg, CEO we received a letter saying that TripAdvisor detected no suspicious activity. Our responses were again removed and we have had to answer each attack (multiple times) as if it was a real customer in order for our account to remain open. We have taken legal action against this psychopath. However, in the meantime our business is shut down and the 40% commission we have been paying to TripAdvisor means absolutely nothing, because TA has aided this psychopath in the ruination of our business by continuing to publicize the fake reviews to all of their constituents i.e. Bokun, Cruise Critic, FlipKey, The Fork, Holiday Lettings, Housetrip, Jetsetter, Niumba, SeatGuru, Viator... We have had no tours since May 1st, 2023 and the fake reviews keep coming.

      "{'reviews': 'DON’T BOOK FLIGHTS THROUGH TripAdvisor.I booked our flights to the USA on a TripAdvisor website in January, for a flight in August this year.   I mistakenly thought that booking through a TripAdvisor website that they would only have companies with good reputations on their website. However, this is certainly not the case. We were lulled into a false sense of security by this, and we booked flights through a company on the website called Globehunters. Firstly, they tried to charge extra for luggage. Premium Economy flights usually come with two checked baggage included. They seem to just try it on. Their Customer Service is very poor. I then selected our seats the same day of booking. Yesterday I thought I would input our passport information, but could not access our booking with the reference number we had so, my husband had to call them today to get a booking reference that worked. He was given another booking reference, but was told that if we wanted this to enable us to select our seats we shouldn’t bother as this would change. My husband didn’t challenge this at the time because we had already chosen our seats. However, I went into our booking only to find that we had no seats selected. I found out by calling Virgin that the problem is because Globehunters have not issued our tickets yet. They advised calling to get these issued. I called Globehunters and explained what I was calling for and the person I spoke to cut the call. I called back and expressed how unprofessional this was. No apology was offered. I explained that I had spoken to Virgin and they told me I should ask for our tickets to be issued to enable us to choose our seats, as there are now only limited seats left.  I was told that  our tickets would be issued next week. Should I believe this?  I have also since seen awful reviews of Globehunters. TripAdvisor should be ashamed at recommending such companies to people. I’m amazed that TripAdvisor are willing to trade their reputation to support this unethical company. I guess it comes down to the commission they receive, which takes precedence over ethics. Shame!!!Date of experience: March 15, 2023', 'date': 'Summary'}\n",

      "{'reviews': \"Fraudulent Promotion Reviews Exposed And Trip Advisor Acted!This is an edit, due to Trip Advisor's reply, which I thank them for, and their action, which was taken swiftly. So, let me explain:I had noticed, using Trip Advisor myself, that The Crown, Sheringham, Norfolk, had received a very obvious fake review, promoting it beyond what other reviews had stated. I, myself, know the pub, and reviewed it fairly as being far too expensive for the locality, and others have stated this on numerous occasions. This issue being it is owned by a large chain, in the UK, called Stonegate Group. All anyone has to do is look at the Stonegate Group web site, and find their pubs, and then just look on Trip Advisor to see if the place in question is one of theirs; the Crown is! This fraudulent review was left by someone called Nick H and he had clearly opened his Trip Advisor account in November 2022, and just for two, random reviews of non-hospitality. Then, after a dormant ew weeks he reviewed 20 pubs/bars and all of them were owned by Stonegate Group! The Crown, Sheringham, included! All of his fraudulent reviews were similar, with the Crown being, ''Amazing pub, great views, great food, great drinks deals. Staff always supper helpful. Always a five star experience''. This was what mad me suspicious! It is wrong! And it is clearly giving itself away with, 'great drinks deals', almost as if the reviewer were trying to appease the unhappy, who regularly complain about drinks prices! So, I then stated that Trip Advisor allow such misuse of their platform. And I now withdraw that. However, when I tried to review The Crown again, which I was entitled to do, as I had been back, and it had been within the time allowed, they blocked my review, because I exposed this Nick H and even listed all of his fake reviews! I thnk this is where Trip Advisor were wrong, as, had they been unsure about my words, all they had to do was write to me and ask for evidence. They didn't. Until I reported this review, and then had to report all 20 other reviews, too. I have to say, that Trip Advisor DID act swiftly, after reading my original review here, and they DID ask me for supporting evidence of the fraud, which I supplied easily; just by going on Stonegate's site, and making screen-shots of the 19 other establishments, to correspond with the fraudulent reviews. Nick H, probably Area Manager for East Anglia, and Stonegate, was dealt with; his reviews all deleted. I just hope he has been barred from Trip Advisor.Next, I went back to Trip Advisor as I had, some time back, noted another Nick doing the same thing. And, yes, I agree, how stupid can these people be, to use the same name?! But, it gets worse, as this Nick would state, for The Crown, for instance, ''Attended a training course for the nee Crown, and drinks and food amazing!'' Then, checking his 14 or so other reviews, they, too, were all for Stonegate Group, and he would go on to say, ''Working from this pub today, and have to say what fantastic prices!'' He would travel around the south of England, reviewing pubs owned by the company, pretending he just HAPPENED to be staying there or passing through! I provided evidence, again, for Trip Advisor, and today I noted both Nicks have been deleted, and all fake, fraudulent reviews they wrote on behalf of Stonegate, have been removed!So, Trip Advisor, well done, as I can see you DO take fraud seriously! I just hope you were able to do something to deter or punish the perpetrators of the reviews I discovered? I am sure they were written by the Area Managers of East Anglia and the south and south east of England, and this just shows the fraudulent activities of Stonegate. But, I have edited, as stated, to let people know that IF they get involved, and report fraud to Trip Advisor, in my experience, they WILL act, and deal with it!Date of experience: March 14, 2023\", 'date': 'Reviews'}\n",

Yet we never appear in any search for the best restaurants in our neighbourhood. Restaurants with much lower rank appears on the top 20.Why have a ranking system at all?!?To add insult to injury one of their salesperson calls me to try to convince me to pay for adds on their website. I complained restaurants with a lot of bad reviews and much lower ratings than mine appear above us. Aparently I would have to pay to feature in the Top 20. In other words, the Top 20 isn\\'t top 20 at all, they are just the business who paid TripAdvisor to be there?!?Another point:  when one searches for the best VEGETARIAN restaurants in... say... Shoreditch London, several steakhouses and others appear in the top of the list but no vegetarian restaurant anywhere to be seen in the first 2 pages. To put this straight, if you are a steakhouse, but serve tomato salad in between all the steaks, you can the  call yourself a \"vegetarian friendly\". Then you pay TripAdvisor to put you on the top. Someone searching for VEGETARIAN ONLY restaurants will see the steakhouse right on the top.  If this is not just wrong, I don\\'t know what wrong is anymore. Basically their search engine is useless, they have no categorisation for vegetarian or vegan and they want me to pay for adds to have my vegetarian restaurant to fight with steakhouses to be seen on a vegetarian list.

I thought they were a great company but thanks to Trustpilot I know I'm not the only one unhappy with their lack of customer care and service.This company is not easy to work with and they are dishonest about their policies. I tried to cancel my monthly subscription only to have it take follow up on my end and three weeks for them to tell me it's a year agreement. They couldn't show me where I signed up for a year and I have confirmed by trying to sign up under another company name that there is no mention of a year term. If you're trying to cancel, good luck with TripAdvisor as they offer little help to business owners who were led to believe there was a benefit to using them. Hopefully you have a good bank that has your back and can cancel the charges. I had a simple request, I'm new at this and I'm not sure what I'm getting for this recurring fee, and they couldn't explain that to me either. What I finally settled on was that the business phone number and website were allowed to be listed on their website for a fee and if my account rep had reached out to help me to set things up on the review side, I could have done it differently but I didn't know that was an option as there was no account manager or contact for anything other than payment forms. Got to love software that is happy to promise the world and take your money and then leave you to figure it out. I’ll take the blame for this as I am new to the game and kept paying the monthly fee because I was too busy to investigate it.Luckily for me, most of my guests prefer to use other places to read and leave reviews so I'll let them all know anything is better than TripAdvisor.When I heard back from normal customer service, and they couldn't help they had M.C., a Senior Customer Success Executive, reach out and he was helpful for two emails, then stopped responding. I reached back out, and he said he had been working on my case. Yet he still didn't have an answer for me, but they were still looking into it, but I couldn't cancel. He was very professional in his responses. I don't envy his job when he must make dog dukies look like prime rib with the unclear policies they have in place.

I read reviews on those that are highly rated with a high number of reviews then make judgements based on good & bad commonalities of what the customers are saying about the operator.  I am a world traveler and I have not been stirred in the wrong direction by TripAdvisor.  All that has changed in my recent long trip to 3 continents.  I just got back today and decided to review TripAdvisor myself.  For the first time, I had 3 bad experiences with 3 tours listed on TA.  All of them were in the Middle East.  One was a no show. Two sent drivers who supposedly were also guides who did not speak English well and do not know much about the place at all. This made me wonder if TA is screening operators listed on their site.  I also found out that the operator I hired subcontracted it to another operator.  This happened a few times.  So the reviews I read and based my decisions on were not valid anymore.  It happened more than once.  When the operators came to pick us up, I asked for the name of the agency and it was different from what was listed on TripAdvisor/Viator that I contracted.  All 3 bad experiences happened in the Middle East.  Viator is owned by TripAdvisor too and they list the same operators in their respective websites.  These recent experiences put my high regard of TripAdvisor & Viator in question.  I am sad that I feel this way because I relied my judgements on their reputations too.

Twice we were able to get into our loft because other tenants were coming and going. On the 3rd night we couldn’t get the owner to answer so we had to Uber to a hotel.

      "{'reviews': 'TripAdvisor is now scammy. Be very very carefulSometime in the last few years TripAdvisor has gone from being an advisor to actually booking hotels/cruises/activities etc through its sister \\'bookings\\' company Viator.com, which TripAdvisor owns. This company is now very dangerous for travellers. Specifically because they do not properly verify the owner of the tour/activity/hotel etc they advertise and so anybody can list themselves as \\'XYZ Cruises, take your money and then do a bait and switch scam on you as you approach your booking dates. Let me give you an example. I booked a cruise in Asia, through the Tripadvisor site, thinking that I was booking it through the real owner of the cruise… I received a confirmation via Viator proporting to be from this Cruise Co.... i.e. the real company itself. Turns out I have booked it with Joe Blow Co. who is advertising that he is Cruise Co. owner. I paid the money in good faith (remember, I currently trust TripAdvisor) and then found out by pure luck that this Joe Blow Co was a fraud who took my money and would have 99% likely contacted me days before the tour date and deceitfully told me that \"unfortunately the cruise cannot run on your day so we have done our best and put you on a \\'similar\\' ship\", which of course would be substandard and much cheaper than the original cruise/tour/hotel/whatever and then he pockets the huge difference. In the end you get a substandard experience, and most likely leave a bad review for the real operator – who then has to wear that reputational damage.Why doesn\\'t TripAdvisor/Viator do something about this and verify its business operators properly??!!! You should also know that this was complained about nearly 10 years ago and they said that their \"engineers we\\'re working on a fix\"... It\\'s now 2022 and the Bait and Switch scam continues. I would recommend only booking through Expedia, Agoda, Booking.com etc and staying clear of booking through TripAdvisor.I used to trust TripAdvisor.

The tripadvisor representatives I have spoken with trying to track down this booking have been, at best, unhelpful. At worst, they have been downright mean. The last rep I talked to shouted at me and kept talking over me. When I asked to speak to a manager she refused to connect me. It was extremely frustrating. I ultimately made a dispute with the bank who was able to track down the source of the charge to my account. The charge was titled \"TA Plus\"... aka \"TripAdvisor Plus\". But Tripadvisor has no record of this booking. It\\'s with this 4th party booking agent. \"Perhaps you left the tripadvisor site and booked with a different party without realizing?\" Ok... I\\'m a reasonable person. We all make mistakes! Maybe I DID do that (but I\\'m still 100% I never left the main tripadvisor site) but this booking agent who has all of my information is just a middle man. You can\\'t actually book anything directly with them. They get info through booking sites and handle it on the back end. What has happened is Tripadvisor is passing some bookings through these sites to handle the booking load but these businesses are NOT trustworthy or dependable. They charged my account immediately but I was given no confirmation, the hotel had note of a request (so they definitely did attempt to book something) but the room type I booked wasn\\'t available and should never have been offered in the first place. It would have been one thing if I made a booking, they kicked it to another business to handle in that middle man role, and I still ended up with the trip I paid for. Instead, I have been charged $800 for something that no one seems to be able to confirm and it was done by a business that no one, even the bank, can contact. Why is tripadvisor doing business with these people? Why was I not warned that these people would be given my information and would be handling my booking? And at the end of the day, I can barely have a basic conversation with the people who are supposed to help me because clearly those jobs have been outsourced to a foreign country. I\\'m sure they\\'d be (mostly) helpful with tracking down a booking or making changes on their end with a booking that exists in their system. But with a complex problem they were absolutely worthless. I won\\'t be using tripadvisor in the future with anything other than maybe as a source for reviews. They used to be trustworthy. Clearly that is no longer the case. I would encourage everyone to use GREAT caution when booking directly through them because you never know who will end up with your information and, if there is a problem, they will not help you.Date of experience: September 30, 2022', 'date': 'November 18, 2022'}\n",

As a result, I became upset when I realized why she was frazzled. Anger kicked in, and I posted an unflattering review of the company. Next, I wrote an admittedly nasty note to the CEO,  Matt Goldberg who has been there less than six months. My guess on his reading what I sent? Zero chance!Shocked - about five hours after my tirade, and on a Monday night around 8 pm, my wife got a call - from Matt Goldberg. Not an assistant. Not an imposter. The CEO!His approach could not have been more reflective of client centered strategic leadership. 1) Apology... agreed situation was not acceptable2) Empathy...  acknowledged her frustration was legitimate. 3) Asked Questions... assuring he understood - cared - and demonstrated respect.4) Restated His Understanding... which enhanced trust; really listening.5) Personal Promise... will be resolved within a day6) Request... if not resolved - call him personally!The next night, I shared with the MBA\\'s I teach (my retirement job) about our experience with Matt Goldberg. Rarely do I have an example of world class leadership. What I shared - lesson to consider:1) Personally Engaged... checking \"customer touchpoints\" - not just relying on what the executive team is sharing.2) Demonstrate Care And Respect... invest the time and effort in a manner that is desired for the entire company culture.3) Action Oriented... rolled up sleeves - and  get things done. Set an example for the team. \"This is what service is!\"Lesson Reinforced. All companies - and people - will make mistakes. It is how mistakes are handled that demonstrate their character and values. Surprisingly, some of the most loyal customers are actually the result of bad experiences - handled in a world class way.My guess? The future of TripAdvisor has never been brighter.

      "{'reviews': 'NOBODY MINDING THE STOREI have booked a tour through TripAdvisor in the region near Vienna Austria.   I\\'m on the hook for nearly US$ 200 for this event.  Terms claimed that the tour would be cancelable up to 24 hours before the official start.  I\\'m still several days away from the cancellation deadline, but will have limited access to a computer in a couple of days.  Yet when I try to cancel the tour (which I decided I did not want to do after all), the \"modify reservation\" button repeatedly says it is unavailable - over the course of a couple of days.  And I wasted several hours trying to find how to contact the company ANY OTHER WAY.  There is none.  I\\'m doubting that I will be able to cancel the tour at this point - and will get stuck paying for their malfeasance.Note after the fact:  I was able to contact the ship company directly. and received a letter stating that they were cancelling the reservation, as I had wished.  I haven\\'t seen the credit card statement yet, but trust it is so.  I still would NOT use Trip Advisor again.  They are quick to take your booking (and money), but difficult to contact, and leave you wondering how to change your booking if your plans are altered.Date of experience: July 30, 2022', 'date': 'US'}\n",

I’m not sure if they have some kind of partnership with them or what but they rejected my review of a hotel for no reason, I raised a query and they just ignored me. Just to double check I logged into my other account and tried to leave a negative review for the same hotel. This time it was kept basic- I wrote I didn’t like the food and entertainment. Only a short paragraph not too specific and it was also rejected. I looked at the other reviews left for the same hotel and they were all positive which was strange considering the negativity on social media. Makes me doubt their honesty now. I always figured they were impartial but i don’t believe this to be the case. They also won’t allow me to post any more reviews since this one hotel review. They ignore my emails when questioned.

The telephone number on our downloaded paperwork took us to an unmanned phone line where noone called us back. The palace made us pay again to enter and Viator the TripAdvisor agent refused to refund. This cost us £75 and TripAdvisor are uncontactable and all their links just take us back to Viator. As an aside, there were no queues to beat and we could have got in cheaper at the gates. The audio guides we paid for were also perfectly adequate.15/09/2022I've seen Tripadvisor's response and it is if no help to me whatsoever.

      "{'reviews': 'Bayshore vacation rental, Galvaston TXWe rented a unit in Galvaston TX at the Bayshore for 2 days. It’s a Victorian house remodeled into 3 vacation rentals. We rented unit 1. There were 8 of us celebrating my son retiring from the Air Force after 20 years. We had difficulty opening the front door. We entered the right number using the keypad but it took several times before we were finally able to get in. The pictures on the internet looked nice but when we got there we could see that the owner spent as little as possible renovating the house. The dining room floor had 2 really bad areas with severe termite damage. You had to be careful not to fall through the rotten wood. 3=of the dining chairs were unsafe to sit in because they were wobbly. The frying pans were disgusting that we had to go out and buy our own frying pans to cook dinner. There were no potholders or sponge to clean the counters. There was a mouse dropping on the stovetop and later in the evening we saw the resident mouse. It appears it is living behind the refrigerator. There is a mouse trap behind the refrigerator so we know the landlord knows about the mouse problem. The cleaning person sprayed oven cleaner all over the oven but only wiped the inside of the oven. The oven cleaner was dry and gross on the side and front of the oven door. There were termites in the dining area that we killed. There were cockroaches running around. The upstairs towel holder in the bathroom was pulling away from the wall. There were 2 coffeemakers but the 12 cup maker didn’t work so we were stuck making coffee in a 5 cup maker. They gave us 1 coffee filter with coffee for a 2 day stay. After seeing the mouse we passed on using their coffee and ended up going to the store to buy ground coffee and filters. The freezer had sand on the shelf. When you pay $500/night you expect better accommodations. We informed the owner and we were told to leave and we would be getting a refund in 15 business days. We sent photos to the booking site and before we got our things in the car they already had it listed again for sale. The house is not in a very “nice” area. The houses nearby and in the back are rundown looking. We hoped this would be a fun experience but it ended up being a nightmare. We ended up in Houston at the Green Tree Inn and it was so much better. I would have given Bayshore a negative star if I could.Date of experience: June 19, 2022', 'date': 'July 15, 2022'}\n",

As a platform where reviews are very important you would expect that there are clear guidelines about writing and placing them. I got a negative review (which I don´t might as long as it is fair) from someone who made a reservation for a walking tour and the guide didn't show up. However I don't offer a walking tour. If you read the review it is clear it is not directed at my tour because the review states the name of the tour, the time it starts and the meetingplace. Which are all different from the tour I offer. So I asked Tripadvisor to remove the review. Tripadvisor sent me an email in which they told me they don't want to remove it. When I asked them why, they answered that the writer of the review had had contact with someone from my company. So I asked when that person had contact with someone from my business and they didn't answer the question. It looks like anyone can randomly review a tour without the need to really join the tour.

Xtreme Antigua Adventure took us right around the island for a day, pointing out or idling at all the places you’ve heard of or thought of booking …. So that was the ‘ordinary’ part of the day. In between times the amazing pilot (Charles) and the crew made us laugh, the whole time. The speed, accuracy and confidence with which they navigated that boat was something that you have to experience. We’ve been on hundreds of tours and excursions in our travels and this is the best experience ever. None of the guests knew each other but the crew made us all feel involved and we were all comfortable together and thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company. ‘Stingray City’ is an amazing experience but even that would have been ordinary without these guys. We got wet and then wet again, we had fun and laughs, we were well fed and everyone of us were completely impressed and a little in love with these guys.Date of experience: April 17, 2022', 'date': 'IE'}\n",

      "{'reviews': \"17 years a reviewer with no problem until last weekI have been writing reviews on Tripadvisor for 17 years and I never had a problem. Even when I had to write truthful negative reviews, the reviews stayed on the site, and sometimes I even received an apology from some restaurant/hotel owners who were honest enough to acknowledge some shortcomings in their services.Last week, someone asked for one of my restaurants' reviews to be removed and unfortunately, I did not check my mail promptly enough to ensure that the review stayed published.  I posted my own photos with the review to prove the truth of my statement, but this restaurant chain obviously cannot stand the truth about their subpar, extremely poor, and rude service.I have now reposted my review with photos and I am waiting for Tripadvisor's reaction. It's very unfortunate that it is impossible to contact Tripadvisor and be able to explain the situation and I think that their customer service should be reachable by reviewers. Otherwise, there is no point in allowing anybody to write reviews. Also, I would like to know who reported my 100% truthful review and I would not be surprised to know that it is someone linked to that wretched restaurant.PS Tripadvisor contacted me on April 7th and I read the mail only on April 11th, and I apologize about that but they should verify who flagged my honest review.Date of experience: April 11, 2022\", 'date': '1 review'}\n",

The building itself is very old and the neighborhood has homeless people hanging around. When we arrived, there was clearly someone not ready for us. There were clothes everywhere (including dirty panties in the room my children were supposed to stay in) The toilets were disgusting and there was a knife left out on the counter where my one-year-old could have reached it. I immediately reached out to the owner who was just as surprised by the condition of the apartment (they manage several so she had no idea which location I was referencing) She offered to refund my money for the inconvenience of being thousands of miles from home with nowhere for our family to stay, but we soon realized all hotels were booked due to the event happening at that time. We waited for about an hour before trying to call again for our refund (she never once answered my calls only text me back) to realize she had blocked mine and my husband's phone numbers. We immediately called TripAdvisor only to be told for the last 6 days that they are unable to refund our money because they cannot get in touch with the owner of the property listed on their website. We had to pay triple what we paid 3 months in advance for this property on a hotel in a different town and cut our trip a day shot to make up for the difference in price. A simple family vacation with our children turned into hour long waits on hold with TripAdvisor trying to get this situation resolved with no calls back though we were promised a follow up several times. At this time, we are still being told that even though we booked with TripAdvisor and had insurance to cover our trip they will not refund our money until the owner gives them permission to do so. All in all, this has been hands down the worst experience I have ever delt with while traveling using a company like TripAdvisor.

Easy to walk but very hot plus knee injury so had a buggy. But this was a people transport no way to secure clubs. So caddy held them on the back seat. A couple of holes cross the runway. I couldn't make full crossing so got a fantastic bounce off the runway ball went miles. Halfway house was interesting. Guys harvesting coconuts in next field. Sold to us. Only drink available. Beer at the end of the round overlooked a lake with crocodiles. Invited back at 6.pm.to see them feeding! Make sure to take passports as on military base. ID required.

      "{'reviews': \"Holiday LettingsSo, I normally write reviews for extremely great service, but in this case, I have to post a negative review.  This review is for HOLIDAY LETTINGS, owned by Tripadvisor.  I have used this company twice.  The first time was last Thanksgiving.  I booked a condo in Paris, and I live in the U.S.  I was charged a deposit and then the full amount was automatically taken from my Paypal account the next day, unauthorized.  I wasn't too concerned since I was going to book it anyway.  Hers's where the fun begins.  I reached out to the owner of the condo with a series of questions.  What is the address?  What is your phone number? etc.  No responses.  Two weeks of questions, zero responses. Keep in mind, I live in the U.S.  I reached out to Tripadisor and asked for a refund.  They informed me there was no refund.  If I cancelled, I lost everything. They reached out to the owner and he responded.  We took the trip and all went well.Round two,  3 weeks ago I booked a condo in Miami.  The trip is this week.  Two days ago I received an email from Trip Advisor that my trip had been cancelled, per the owner.  I asked how the owner could cancel a booking but I was not allowed to do the same a few months earlier.  The answer?  The owner will be charged a cancellation fee.  I asked who gets that money?  We do, replied the Tripadvisor rep.  So let me get this straight, if I cancel I lose my entire payment, if the owner cancels they pay Tripadvisor a fee and I lose my booking and I am not compensated in any way?  His reply, that is correct sir. I understand your frustration but we will help you find another property.  They proceeded to send a group of properties that were several hundred dollars more for a 4 night stay, even a few one bedroom listings when we had booked a two bedroom property.  I have used them twice, each time was a bad experience.  If you are using Holiday Lettings, owned by Trip Advisor, proceed with extreme caution.Date of experience: February 21, 2022\", 'date': 'March 02, 2022'}\n",

Sadly though, we were told that as we were over an hour late for our booking, the system had cancelled our reservation as is their policy which wasn’t written anywhere nor practiced by the other operators in the same office.

And the worst thing about my vacation: my PCR test was positive, and I had to sit in the room for 10 days.  During these 10 days I did 4 tests that showed a positive result although there were no symptoms.  The hotel room is not bad except for the smell of bloom and humidity in the room. The big downside was that no one ever came to pick up the garbage. And of course food: every time food was brought, it was cold. Instead of getting breakfast at 9 am, I got it at 11am or 12 pm o'clock and supper at 10-11pm.

I asked the Hotel Edison staff what it was for and they told me for things that I did not use at all such as business Center, breakfast, water, and the gym. Also the room wasn’t even cleaned properly when we arrived (The bellhop told us we had to go downstairs again and get another room). The second room was not thoroughly cleaned either (coffee dispenser not emptied) but we were running late for tickets at MOMA so we had to just live with it.

I believe that I have selected October 3rd, 2021 as the date for the tour. Together with my family I drove down to the Ken's Tour site for 5 hours. And when I got there it turned out that the booking was actually for the next day - October 4th, 2021. The Ken's Tour manager Zack Welch offered me the full refund, because the reservation was made less than 72 hour ago. However, when he saw that I had booked through the third party, he said to talk to them. Tripadvisor forwarded the case to Viator and they said that they need  the written consent by email from their supplier for the full refund. The Ken's Tour manager said that they will be looking for the email and will reply immediately. It turned out that they never received the email, because Tripadvisor's or Viator's supplier was not the Ken's Tour, but some other aggregator by the name Wannar Travel.So, in summary, Tripadvisor accepts payment online for the service they do not provide, Viator receives payment for the service they don't provide, Wannar Travel impose the policies for the service they don't provide and the tour operator that actually provides the service can't follow their own customer service agreements because booking has been done through a third party.The word of advise - you can use Tripadvisor for search, however, never pay through Tripadvisor but rather go directly to the actual service provider site and buy there.

      "{'reviews': 'Do Not TrustDo Not Trust! Trip advisor is removing posts?I had left two negative reviews for The Atlantis \"resort\" in Reno Nevada, one concerning the hotel/spa and one for a restaurant in the building (which has it\\'s own independent Trip Advisor page). At the same time, I left two positive reviews for their main competitor down the street, the Peppermill Casino. Again one for the hotel/spa and another for a restaurant which is also in their building. A couple days later I get a notification that my negative reviews were removed, stating I am only allowed to leave one review per property, per visit, and only every three months. Obviously, the Atlantis complained to Trip Advisor, as my multiple positive reviews for Peppermill remain up. So this \\'multi review per visit\\' policy isn\\'t enforced equally.This leads me to believe Trip Advisor star ratings are definitely manipulated and not reflective of user\\'s actual experiences (unless they are positive of course). The inability to leave a review for restaurants and other amenities, which have their own independent Trip Advisor pages, is thoroughly dishonest. If I stay at a resort hotel for several days, and visit multiple restaurants, etc. I should be able to individually review any of their services which have their own pages. Why else would they have independent Trip Advisor presence?This manipulation of star ratings and feedback is dishonest, in my opinion.I posted about this in Trip Advisor\\'s forum. It generated a thoughtful discussion concerning Trip Advisor\\'s manipulation of star ratings for their paid / premium clients. They have since removed the entire topic.Is Trip Advisor afraid of honest feedback, of both themselves and their paid subscriber businesses?Date of experience: September 07, 2021', 'date': 'About'}\n",

He was unhappy because the weather did not cooperate. He claimed he was unhappy because we have 2.5 baths and not three baths as listed. The site does not allow you to put down 2.5 baths. We are one toilet short of 3 baths. He was a small group of 7 family members, and lack of one toilet did not impede his use or enjoyment of our Lake home. He was pissed because the weather was bad and he could not enjoy the Lake. He never even reached out to us with a problem when he was at our house. Flip Key and Travel Advisor nevertheless just literally gave this guy a full refund, over $3,000, over our objection. Over lack of a toilet at our Lake house! This should tell you how they stand behind their hosts.  Joke of a reservation site for hosts and home owners. Take your business to AirBnb. We get 95% of our renters through AirBnb and never have a problem with them as guests.

I'm an attorney and explained to them the difference between a material misrepresentation and negligible omission in an listing. A lack of a third toilet, for three adults and four kids, did not impede the guests' use of our house.  Did not matter to Flip Key / Trip Advisor.  Full Refund issued to the renter.

My business has the same name as another business in another town a couple miles away and a customer reviewed the wrong takeaway as we don't serve those dishes. I have reported and flagged it multiple times to tripadvisor but all of it was ignored and their customer service isn't much of any help as they stated that the customer posted it on ours so it shouldve been ours even though we had evidence. We have lost so many customers due to negative reviews being post in the wrong location however tripadvisor doesn't care. As a small business this has affected us massively and to them they do not care.

In checking a few specific locations I noticed their reviews changed dramatically from primarily negative to positive and I am certain they are paying to remove negative reviews.

      "{'reviews': 'Tripadvisor censors certain reviews and a company\\'s average rating can be biasedI accuse Tripadvisor of removing reviews without contacting the person who posted the review to verify its veracity (i have evidences). This has happened to me often (recently on the airline Transavia for proven facts). I painfully remember a terrible hotel in Costa Rica, rated 4.5 / 5 so supposed to be excellent and in no way did this establishment deserve this rating. I posted a review after this bad experience and Tripadvisor deleted it several times because I was reposting. It must be said that this hotel was bookable on Tripadvisor. My opinion is that Tripadvisor ratings for an establishment or a company are unreliable because by keeping positive reviews and deleting negative reviews, mathematically the rating of a restaurant or hotel goes towards a 5 / 5 for all establishments, so for those who deserve this rating for the quality of their service, and for the bad ones who manage to remove negative ratings. It should also be remembered that the same person can create 10 emails and post 10 notices for the same company since there is no identity check, nor verification that the person has used the service. As proof, jokers have managed to create fake restaurants when they did not exist and this proves that Tripadvisor does not check anything and the worst is that these fake restaurants have obtained customer reviews !. I therefore have no confidence in the ratings given by Tripadvisor to companies. I think that some companies have privileged access to Tripadvisor and manage to obtain the removal of negative reviews, whether they have a \"marketing\" contract with them or whether they offer their hotel for booking (so clearly a conflictof interests) on Tripadvisor or simply that they threaten Tripadvisor with legal action. I reposted the review on Transavia which is factual on Tripadvisor, and if they remove it again, I go to the competition department of Europe. Because there is a distortion of competition when the negative ratings of a bad company are removed and that company is rated as well as a company which is excellent for the quality of its services. I pay tribute to Trustpilot which does not remove reviews like Tripadvisor censors certain reviews without any contact to verify the facts, and a company\\'s average rating can be biased and may not represent a company\\'s true worth.Date of experience: August 01, 2020', 'date': 'GB'}\n",

Because of it being a long day, what with the drive from Dorset and completing my business, I decided that it would be best to stay in an Hotel for the night. We stayed in the Best western Hotel Hatfield. we, actually, stayed at The lodge, which is across the road from the main Hotel. This was because we wanted a Twin room and there are none in the main Hotel. Well, I have stayed there before, in the main Hotel, but never in The Lodge, so i didn't know what to expect.But WHAT a pleasant surprise. The Room, with the two single Bed's in, was very spacious and the Bed's were very comfortable. And the Room was very clean and tidy. The bathroom was also very clean, and tidy, and the Shower was just right. after such a long journey we both had showers and dressed for our evening Meal, which was across at the main Hotel Restaurant. That's when it went a bit wrong, I'm afraid.We both had starters, a Prawn Cocktail each ,which were generous portions and VERY nice. For our main course: my Son ordered Hunters Chicken and I ordered Battered Cod. Mine was delicious, and a generous size, about the best Fish that I have had for a very long time I MUST say. And I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. But my son couldn't eat his he was put off by how it was piled up and he didnt like the taste of it. So, he told the Waitress and She knocked it off the bill and provided Him with a drink courtesy of the Hotel and expressed Her apologies to my Son for the meal not being up to the standard that he expected.

Having to cancel our booking due to Covid-19 and the fact the place we were staying was on the news due to dangerous overcrowding and no social distancing, with the local council saying to stay away. Trip Advisor won't refund the deposit as the stay is after 31st July. Owner won't refund the deposit as they are following Trip Advisors guidelines which is well within their right. Wish I'd booked with Airbnb, they have extended their refunds into August as recognise travellers safety is more important than profits.Edit:I appreciate Trip Advisor confirming the reasons for my review. As stated, my issue isn't with the owner, who when we discussed me wanting to cancel the trip due to Covid-19, explained that they were following Trip Advisors policy in not refunding the deposit. They would obviously lose money if they deviated from it and I wouldn't expect them to be out of pocket. My issue is with Trip Advisor who feels that the danger of Covid-19 stops on 31st July. Convenient, as I imagine most of their bookings are in August. At least Airbnb are looking after both travellers and property owners during this situation by regularly reviewing their Covid-19 policy, ensuring neither are out of pocket should they need to cancel.Date of experience: July 16, 2020\", 'date': '1 review'}\n",

If you search for a restaurant you know where is, you can experience that the restaurant is not to be found on any map, and even if you enter the street it does not turn up. Only if you enter the exact name of the restaurant, does it show up. One out of 10 examples in Bardolino is Restaurant Caprice in Via Goffredo Mameli 3, 37011 Bardolino, Province of Verona, Italy. Try zooming in on the map - not there. Try entering Via Goffredo Mameli - not there.Another problem is that almost half the locations are wrong, typically it is the home of the owner and not the restaurant that is listed. A quick search on google maps will help you here - but never ever trust TripAdvisor’s addresses or directions.The conclusion is that you can only use it to check out restaurants that you already know - really a pity, because it is a great concept.Date of experience: July 08, 2020', 'date': 'About'}\n",

In calling TripAdvisor, the agent could (/would) not do anything until pressed, then the agent said look out for emails.  2 days later I receive an email from TripAdvisor saying:“Unfortunately, we have not been able to contact Expedia to cancel your booking due to the high volume of calls they have been receiving. We would have to ask you, in this case, to call Expedia on your side in order to cancel your booking without paying for a fee, as we are not able to do it.”Very, very telling about customer service and through a “contracted” party.  After all, I received a TripAdvisor confirmation with a TripAdvisor confirmation number.I called the booked location.  But they could do nothing because Expedia would charge them. Our booking was made 6 weeks ahead of our scheduled visit.  We tried to cancel 4 days ahead of our visit because we were a government classed “vulnerable persons” due to the Coronavirus.  I was looking for some understanding from TripAdvisor, the booking party.  Instead I learnt the company was happy to palm us off and use a partner it cannot communicate with – not what is expected.Date of experience: March 26, 2020', 'date': 'About'}\n",

Only to find out that the owner decided to cancel the booking 3 months later. Gutted! It was really hard to find something in a first place as we had 5 teenagers with us. So when we recovered from the shock we quickly had to find somewhere else. First the stress of searching and then we had to find another deposit as we had to wait for a week to get our deposit back. Funny enough when we booked, the money came out of the bank the following day! We had to compromise on few things and the holiday costed more money. When I received the deposit refund back, it was £60 less. I know that doesn't sound like a lot of money but £60 is £60 after all. But it's the principle. I understand it is due to the exchange rate but that's totally stupid. So no holiday and £60 short. I am so enoyed. The owner is not effected by this nor is the travel company - I am the one being £60 short for absolutely no reason. I will never use Holiday Lettings or TripAdviser. Disqusting! Apparently there is nothing that can be done, I somehow don't believe that I am the first pearson this has happend to and can't understand that there is nothing in place for these problems.

The entertainment when i was there was ran by a young lady called Bebe for short she was very enthusistic and terrific fun and we enjoyed activites such ss killer pool,killer darts,archery boucha (French Bowls) and Scholen and at night this was replaced by bingo and kareoke in the bar.Another great asset they have was Libby behind the bar a Welsh girl who was helpful enthusiastic and fun at all times smiling from ear too ear.In short a terrific place exceptional staff, they have large ( a bit dated rooms) but clean and were cleaned everyday good bars a large range of food and drink and entertainment.The hotel hosts guests from all over so as well as British theres German Russian Spainish and French infact from all over so if this is a problem for you think seriously as the British in this hotel are not the majority saying that everyone got on almost like a Large family.To some it up a great 2 star hotel i think should be at least 3stars and fantastic value for money.Date of experience: February 21, 2020', 'date': 'GB'}\n",

While I understand the need for companies to earn revenue, this 'need' for monetization has impaired the usefulness of TripAdvisor.  At one time, when researching 'things to do', the results were presented by traveler rating, providing a fairly unbiased ranking of the options. Today they are listed and ranked firstly by all of the options that can be booked through TripAdvisor and Viator.  You've monetized the ranking process, putting your corporate revenue goals ahead of providing unbiased traveler rankings.  Your Viator options appear ahead of all other options, pushing other options out of the picture.  As a result, I now canvass other sources to help me learn about and experience destinations, and I consciously avoid booking through TA.  I've also dramatically cut back on the number of TA reviews I post, which is a shame since I am a very frequent international traveler. It's also a shame, because what was a wonderful, unbiased resource has morphed into a process where users are funneled into Viator for revenue purposes.Date of experience: February 04, 2020\", 'date': 'February 04, 2020'}\n",

      "{'reviews': 'The most reliable site for reviewsTripAdvisor is wonderful. It is the most reliable site for reviews. I feel confident that efforts have been made to weed out fake reviews. Also, I have a discerning eye and can tell from a review whether or not it is reliable or even if I would have the same opinion. For example, when my daughter was little, I made a reservation for a hotel that received a bad review for having too many children staying there. So, the details in that review told me that I would like the place. Also, I trust the TripAdvisor awards of excellence. In fact, many of my reviews are positive because I go to places that I have checked out beforehand on TripAdvisor and I usually know that I will like the place! I do have a concern that some women who said they have been assaulted in certain hotels said that they have had their reviews taken down. I believe those reviews should remain on the site. However, I don’t know how best for TripAdvisor to handle such situations. I have not used TripAdvisor for travel reservations and cannot rate the site on that aspect.Date of experience: February 03, 2020', 'date': '4 reviews'}\n",

We have a dedicated team of fraud investigators who work tirelessly to protect the site from fake reviews.”One hotel I know very well is Mercure Cairo Le Sphinx. I have stayed there many times and it is no better than a 3 star property. Despite this it continues to receive floods of 5 star reviews from persons who have only ever made one contribution to TripAdvisor.As Builder49 I have complained on three occasions to TA via their website flagging system since September regarding these continuing fake reviews yet they do nothing. Since January 18, 2020 six further obviously fake 5 star reviews have appeared. There have been no likely genuine reviews. The six reviews are all no more than 3 lines long while praising the staff for good service.Since TripAdvisor have no interest in maintaining their review system I call it out as being untrustworthy and a totally broken system.Edit late 24/01/20 - link for the previously stated hotel sent to TA.Edit late 27/01/20 - Three further obviously fake 5 star reviews have been added since the TA comment below.

Although the hotel is older, and probably justifies a 3 star rating, the hotel has such a good vibe, the fun factor pushes the rating to 4 stars. The hotel is basic but clean. However, its the pool and beach that are selling points. The beach is clean and has about 100'+ of white sand beach face. The pool is large and with plenty of tanning space. Daily entertaiment by the pool is awesome. And so are the staff who create this super friendly vibe! Special shout out to Crystal, Keano at the front desk, Alexander for bringing us food and drinks on the beach, and Monique with cabana/beach services. Breezes is also great value.

I then sent alot of emails over a 2 month period asking to see some evidence or statement to prove I had an outstanding amount and guess what.....I received no response. Normally, if there was an outstanding amount, i would receive a notification on my back of house but never received any notifications at all. Then i went to my bank and requesting to have the money refunded....I received most of the money back eventually. Tripadvisor in there bullying ways concocted a story to penalise my rating (i was number 8 for all restaurants in the area) by accusing one of my staff of posting a review to benefit my business.

I find that 98% of all the info I get from reviews are good,solid information but I also find that a person who had one small thing go wrong will often make it worse than it really was. A bad server does not require someone to say. The food was bad when it was really good but the server was not. We have to be realistic. This is not a business with me. I just like to have a good time and feel that we have to let people know what is good and what is not good.  We all spend our hard earned money and want to get a good return and value.So happy travels.We have to trust someone in these crazy times of ours.

In April I stayed at a hotel where TA advertised the add of being completely renovated in Feb. only to go and see it was not even close! In November 2019 I got a email from trip advisor saying since the hotel is NOW complete ,and they will remove my review from APRIL 2019....why then did TA allow the misleading advertising prior??? are they getting advertising $$ I think so and this makes them a highly unreliable source now, and we must really look at the patron's reviews and make your own decisions most importantly visit other sites like google and monarch to see if it jives.** So below is your response makes no sense, so you remove reviews that were placed during the time of false advertising by the the hotel and by TA since it was on tripadvisor that I read the ad stating it was completely renovated since February.

I called the hotel which told us that my reservations were cancelled then I check my credit card and it showed a \"charge\" but no refund. So I\\'m out $627. I wrote to Tripadvisor since they listed this \"partner\" on their website so they should have a responsibility. Their answer was, we are sorry.A company like yours cannot so easily disown a partner and allow partners to create these type of financial issues. Tripadvisor has a responsibility to ensure that each partner is financially stable, especially when it\\'s an international company.

YET - at the same time, Tripadvisor tends to just lump everything together under Los Angeles when it comes to giving the name of the city of whatever is being reviewed.  As an example, I want to specify someplace as in Woodland Hills, which is the far NW end of Los Angeles area... this is much more meaningful than a \\'generic\\' Los Angeles, which could be in Watts - 35 miles away and about 1.5 hours drive!!!!  2)  When adding a new listing, why can\\'t we review AND submit photos at the same time?  We may not know when the new listing is approved, and our memories may not be as good as when we first try to get the new listing in, along with photos.  I\\'m complained about this before to Tripadvisor, but it seems that this goes nowhere ... nor do I get a HUMAN response to these suggestions ... which can lead one to wonder ... \"Does anybody CARE at Tripadvisor?\"Date of experience: September 10, 2019', 'date': '1 review'}\n",

I received a call from a Wyndham representative that stated he would record our call.  After I said it’s fine as long as I can record as well.  He stated I couldn’t record and he ended the call. It appears that the legal team or representative for the Vacation Club has persuaded  a site used by consumers to receive true reviews.   TripAdvisor is unfairly dismissing a true and honest review for no warranted reason.  I went back and there are over 100 other reviews with negative mentions of their experience with the pressure of the timeshare experience at checkin.  So, the reason for not listing my review is not true.  I am sad and baffled.  I have trusted TripAdvisor for many years and unless something is done to rectify this unwarranted dismissal, I plan to never use them again and spread the fact that if your review is very damaging yet true about a large company/business or corporation, it may or may not be allowed, hence skewing the star ratings in favor of the big wigs.

Part of the problem rests with the reviewers.  If there are too many positives, are they planted.  If there's one really lousy review, is it someone who simply wants to hear him or herself talk, makes them sound like a big shot, without the decency to take up the perceived problem face to face.  I know there's not much that can be done about either of these, and one hopes people actually take the time to read the reviews, and take them for what they are.  One flaw I think could be addressed is the length of time reviews stay on line.  For instance, a problem with an accommodation, or a product, that occurred 3 years ago, has probably been remedied.  I always take the dates of bad reviews into account, but how many people just don't bother?  My suggestion is take down reviews after two years.

Bottom line is this, do not trust trip advisor because they block negative reviews that could make you aware of  scams, security issues, or anything negative about a property.

There should be a sort order for Most Helpful Reviews.  More often than not, the review is not helpful.  You should also be able to vote on the review as not helpful.3) New Look - recently, I've noticed a new look and feel for reviews whereby important information shown before is not shown anymore - such as how many reviews this person has done and where the person lives.  When I see a negative review and the reviewer only has done 1 review, I do not give it any merit because this person does not have any credibility.

Wrathful diatribes, three words and a something-star-rating or whining rambles by guests paying for a sow's ear and expecting a silk purse should generally be discounted, but recurring themes for both satisfaction and dissatisfaction can generally be trusted.Regarding the offers: They are generally good value, and as the offerings span a number of accomodation or table booking websites, the range is broader than just about anywhere else.Regarding TripAdvisor's marketing: It gets a bit much along the way.

      "{'reviews': 'Just don\\'t trust Tripadvisor : they delete bad review without any notice even when you have all proofs of your bad experienceI travel when i can, and i posted bad reviews about an hotel or a company just because they made a bad job and it\\'s normal to inform the others travelers about the problems they can face in such places. Each time i had the proof i was there, i have the pictures and of course, it\\'s a real review about a real experience. I have no time to waste making fake reviews.When i travel, sometimes it\\'s difficult to know if an hotel or a service is good or not and if the rate fit with the services provided : the important value for money.And Tripadvisor succeed without any check of the ID of the person which write a review, without any proof this person have been in that place, to be the reference for travelers and sometimes, even you know it can be fake , you have a look and you choose a place with good reviews and note on Tripadvisor.  Also today you can find outside many restaurants a \"Tripadvisor paper\" which show 4 or 5 stars. But there is not the name of the restaurant, there is no year (as you can be awarded for 2015 but not for 2017) and anybody can make such document on its computer and print it for display on the window !It\\'s an incredible phenomena when people trust this company which never send anybody to the restaurants, hotels, attractions.. to check by themselves.So many times, i choose hotels looking the reviews and the average note : sometimes it was fair, but many times the Tripadvisor doens\\'t correspond at all to the experience i got for the rate i paid. And some hotels, after an average note rising feels the right to increase seriously their prices when the reviews were done with another value for money.I had 2 recent terrible cases where Tripadvisor deleted my reviews (but more in the past), even with pictures, without email me what was wrong and when they do that they break the rules and the rights of consumers and travelers to give also their opinion. Also mathematically : when you delete the bad reviews, the average note is increasing seriously and you might have for instance 2 hotels : one which make a perfect job (so they get good reviews), taking care of all and another which makes a real bad job (and they get bad reviews which aren\\'t published on Tripadvisor and it\\'s a censure). For those samples,  on Tripadvisor the average notes are almost the same. Which is very unfair for the hotels which make a perfect job to satisfy the customers when the other one make a bad job and get what we can call a special protection against bad reviews from Tripadvisor.Recently, i had 2 cases and i am honnest :- Last March 2018 :  one nature lodge in Costa Rica called Esquinas Rainforest in Golfito where i booked and paid 3 nights because i wanted to have nature tours. First the hotel was really basic for the rate (tours were on top) and i had lunch when i arrived : believe me it was very weird as the starter and the main course has a bad and abnormal taste (like unfresh) and i just took a spoon of each. So as i was staying there, i told the waitress the food wasn\\'t good at all and that i was hoping better food for the next meals, even simple. 5 minutes the costa-rican boyfriend of the daugher of the owner arrived, screaming in the restaurant when other guests were looking and ask me to leave the hotel. I was very calm and i refused as i paid 3 nights and he called the police. After a discussion with the police, they said they can\\'t reproach anything to me but according to them it was better to leave because the manager was visibly drunk . They refunded me and i took a taxi. I didn\\'t have time to reach another room as i was really sick after the unfresh little food i had.  This hotel was notes 4.5 on Tripadvisor and it\\'s why i choose them and they have a \"Certificate of Excellence\". I know it\\'s unbelievable but i swear it happened and they deleted all the reviews tentatives i made. So taking only good reviews is a manipulation of the reviews and give a bad information to travellers.- I get mad when it happened again in Botswana in a lodge i paid more then 2000 USD per night and for that palace price, i get a 2 stars unmaintained lodge. The name is Wilderness Vumburas plains and belong to Wilderness-safaris. The private pool i had was brownish-green under a tree and the staff told me it\\'s because birds made them lighter dropping in the pool ! So they knew the problem and for years they didn\\'t protect the pool or move its location. Also this lodge was very miserable for the rate, not maintained, very faded furniture so very far from what i was expecting at such level of price.  Also when i was on my bed, the mosquito net falled on me and was retained by the fan !  It\\'s just unbelievable but it also happened and of course i complained to wilderness-safaris which never answer for the value for the money i paid for such miserable experience.So i posted 3 successive reviews on tripadvisor and all of them have been deleted without any explanation by email. I have the pictures of the broken net, the green pool, the faded furniture and the invoice. So it was a real experience and today this Vumburas Plains lodge is noted 4.5 on 5 when it is a pure scam for that level of rate. Even if you pay 300 USD per night it\\'s not a good deal and a good experience.So what can i say ??  Tripadvisor is making a distorsion of competition , advantaging some places, and manipulating the reviews, refusing to publish the bad ones. I know also they make some business with some hotels, a kind of marketing so may it\\'s the part of the deal to suppress the bad reviews. It\\'s just an hypothesis as it is very strange to act like this despite evidences - so these bad properties can have a very good reviews level when they don\\'t deserve it at all. And customers are scammed with no value for their money when they have great expectations.For me such company have to be controlled and checked by autorities : get ID of persons writing reviews, have a proof of stay and accept all reviews and at least contact the person if something is wrong in the review (bad word..).so today i won\\'t connect anymore to Tripadvisor as the data aren\\'t trustable at all----------------------------------Answer to Tripadvisor : i won\\'t join you on a private link when you delete my real experiences without contact me by email. And also you don\\'t have any \"contact me \" on your website because i will have contact you to have explainations when you deleted  so many of my reviews but it wasn\\'t possible.So i have been in Botswana : i have the stamps on my passport, the international flights, i have an invoice of 22,000 USD for 8 nights with 3 lodges of Wilderness-Safaris (incl domestic flights not international). So for such crazy rate, i was expecting a lot and i get a dirty polluted pool, a mosquito net broken and a poor experience. You deleted my reviews about Vumbura plains without any notice , i tried 3 times successively and 2 were deleted the 31th, and i added a 3rd one and i saw you deleted it the 1st november 2018. I have the screen copies of all these reviews with \"time stamp\" which were posted and deleted without any reason. It was just the truth and the experience i had - and believe i will had prefer to have the 22,000USD on my bank account than spend it so stupidely with wilderness-safaris. And you did that so many times with my reviews : i had others bad experiences as i travel few times a year, but also you deleted them, again without any notice. So what is the real reason : it\\'s an hypothesis but probably you have some business with those hotels/lodges/companies as on your website you display this1 -  \"Drive direct booking referrals withBusiness Advantage Industry-leading tools designed to better market your property to potential guests and connect them to your direct booking channels.\"2 - \"Welcome to TripAdvisorThe only place to reach 375 million loyal, engaged and connected travellers a month actively planning and booking a trip!\"3 - You get commissions on hotels bookings May be deleting the bad reviews for this lodge, or some others is the part of the \"advantage\" and a good reason for hotels when they sign a contract with Tripadvisor.As you advertise for some hotels, pushing the travelers to some websites like booking.com or expedia.com and in Costa Rica you refused many times also my true experience as you were getting commissions for the booking of this lodge. I have also the screen copies of my reviews which were posted and deleted immediately and i have also of the screen copy of your proposal to book this lodge at the same period. Don\\'t you think there is an huge conflict of interests ? Do you think you can honnestly publish \"independant notes and reviews\" when you have a business with some of these companies. Specially when this lodge was just awful and he has 4.5 with you (Esquinas Rainforest in Golfito), when its value is for me 1.5 when a very good National Geographic Lodge called Lapas Rios has 5 but they deserved the 5, even more, so it\\'s very unfair to see 2 lodges which are like night and day, have a very good note on Tripadvisor when in one you are in hell (it\\'s not a joke - the experience was terrific) and the other one was just paradise. How it can happened ??  Please explainMathematically when bad reviews are deleted : the note is increasing slowly to be a 4.5 or even a 5 !   This is very unfair for travelers which check your website to choose an hotel or restaurant, and it\\'s what i did and also very dishonnest with the places which works hard to provide the best service.For me Tripadvisor is a way to warn travelers to avoid bad experiences, but also i don\\'t like you as i know there is a lot of fakesfor instance i found these linksyoutube com watch?v=_kJz07D1RE0--------------la tyrannie des avis :youtube com watch?v=67pwoL6nfMMand also i saw a TV document showing how easy it was to buy fake positive reviews on Tripadvisor in Madagascar for hotels which want a better rating !   how can you accept that  ?Date of experience: November 01, 2018', 'date': 'January 07, 2019'}\n",

Returning the money, perhaps minus an administrative fee, for provable events beyond the customer\\'s control is good business practice. The majority of booking agencies allow full cancellations up to two days before and, at most, retain the first day\\'s deposit for less time, including those on TripAdvisor, such as booking.com or hotels.com.This is important: for the first time, the booking said it was by TripAdvisor and their “wholly owned subsidiary, Holiday Lettings, Ltd.” in the UK.

Tripadvisor accusing and bullying small businesses of writing fake reviews or just cancel your reviews without any explanation if not a pre-written email that automatically comes back to you when you write to the customer service. I never used but recently I went back to a place where I was a couple of month ago and I decided that I wanted to set up my account and wrote a bunch of reviews of my last couple of month travelling, almost all of them were refused without any explanation except for one. While they refused my reviews they wrote an email at the owner of the place where I\\'m staying (I reviewed this place too) accusing them that an affiliate of them was writing good reviews for them and negative reviews for similar businesses. I did wrote 8 reviews all of them at 5 or 4 stars, and all of them were positive (I\\'ll never write a negative review trying to harm a small business). At the moment I asked them why they cancel almost all the reviews using the contact form, but to be sure they will reply I\\'m writing them a genuine bad review as they do deserve it, because bullying people is not what a respectable company should do. I\\'m not affiliate with any business that I reviewed and all my reviews were genuine, are yours on this website TA?EDIT: So I need to put an update about this, yesterday I authorized the manager of the hostel that has been took into this matter to send to TA the documents relative to the booking I made months ago and to which the review TA contested were related, I also received myself a stupid \\'automatic\\' response for TA after I asked explanation about the matter. This is my response to stupidity:Dear E.What are you doing is harassing a small business with no reason (along with xxxx I wrote you a bad review in TRUSTPILOT were all this is explained), you also wrote them that they will be penalized because of my review, I don\\'t have any affiliation with The xxx xxxxxx reality is that this place is so good that I came back to xxxx and I decided to stay here again, I also decided to start using your website (worst call ever, I\\'ll have my profile removed as soon as I\\'m done writing you this email). I know all the story and yesterday I authorized xxxx (the manager) on sending you my reservation made last May as proof of the genuineness of my review.I don\\'t really care much if you publish or not my review but you don\\'t have any right to penalize a business when you have in your hands the proof that a reservation was made and a review was submitted based on that reservation, IT IS MY RIGHT to write what I want in your site (and take my responsibility for what I write) from wherever I am, I\\'m a digital nomad and I am working remotely so I use a VPN sometimes to use particular websites I would never had thought that Tripadvisor will use that against the business I reviewed.I hope you look back to your actions, waive your penalties and send your apologies to the business, meanwhile I\\'ll write some articles on my blog (and I\\'ll ask to some other friend to publish it) about the way your company is bullying small business and give no chance to them to protect themselves against any action you\\'re going to take, I will also go back to Trustpilot and edit my review and I\\'m going to expose the unprofessional way your company handled this matter.I attach the other part of the reservation.I hope you have a good day.Regards, MarkusAn so it is, I removed my profile from TA and I\\'ll spend some of my free time write a very detailed article about you, as I\\'m travelling a lot it will take some time because I want to ask about the experience with you and your customer service to more businesses and users, but I won\\'t let go. If I was one of your employers I\\'ll be ashamed to work for you.no regards this time.EDIT: I\\'ve been contacted by TA privately, they ask more information, I gave my email and this message: \"Hello, you know already everything. I\\'m going to leave the hostel soon so it\\'s time to end this, you got everything that proofs that I made a reservation at the hotel, I stayed at the hotel and I had the right to write a review, as I said, I\\'m not an affiliate of Txx Zxx xxxtel, I\\'m just a customer. I wrote a genuine review and you making wrong accusation.

Again I want to remark that TA is bullying small business and ask for money to them for have a better position on their listing, for every business that will read this I want to say that if you don\\'t have the money to afford the expenses to be a TA goldmember avoid the platform it will give you little advantage and many troubles.EDIT: After I read the tripadvisor response to this review I don\\'t have any more words, I send to them all the proofs of a reservation and my ID yet they still penalize the business because they are claiming I am an affiliate (that is writing a review in the middle of the off season time at 2 month from his last visit to the place), they also asking me if in need more information?

The last couple years I started noticing their rather continual barrage of advertisements for services arranging airlines, hotels, car rentals, etc. While that bothered me somewhat, it wasn't until they started declining to post reviews they felf were too controversial or political that I felt enough was enough.  It wasn't just me either, as I had several friends who had rejected postings tell me the same thing - even when all our reviews dealt with things like the atmosphere or clientele of certain establishments.  These are things people want to know.  It has become apparent that TripAdvisor has abandoned their original business focus, which was to provide honest, unbiased reviews of things and places.  They have become a rather mediocre organiazation that really is more about money and supporting its advertisers rather than providing truthful and insightful reviews.  Crazy as it sounds, I now use Yelp as the souce of my reviews, at least for restaurants and hotels.  I think they honestly do a much better job, and don't seem nearly as interested in placating and not offending their advertising base.  I unsubscribed from TripAdvisor and won't be looking back.

They say they may do away with owner- subscriptions altogether, and just charge the traveler up to 16%. Customer service is non-existent.

Nothing has been changed in my account; but one CS rep implied that it was a technical issue or because of a change in their policy.  I was told 5 different answers on what was wrong, I have done everything the CS people have instructed, but still no help.  CS has lied to me that I would be called by the finance team, a Supervisor, or at least get an email addressing the problem.  I have received no correspondence from Trip Advisor, in the last 5 days, to assist me with this non-payment issue.  I have called numerous times asking for this issue to be escalated.  No one will tell me why I am not being paid or escalate the issue to someone who can address the problem.

      "{'reviews': 'Just what is TripAdvisor\\'s agendaJust what is TripAdvisor\\'s agenda?  They advertise as being the world\\'s largest travel site with the purpose of helping us make the most of every trip with candid traveler reviews.I used TripAdvisor to help me choose an ashram in India for my yoga teacher training.  The reviews were very positive.  However, my experience (and the experience of fellow travelers at the ashram for retreat and ayurveda studies) proved very different from the impression TripAdvisor led us to expect.  The ashram advertised as a Yoga Alliance certified school, but did not adhere to the standards.  I was inadequately trained and many important aspects of teacher training were omitted.  When I tried to post a candid review on TripAdvisor, they would not accept it.  When I questioned why, I was not provided with anything other than a general form letter response to say they could not publish.  I have re-written my review several times and have been unpublished each time.  I have also discovered that fellow guests that stayed at the ashram during the same one month period that I was there have similarly had their reviews removed or refused publication.This ashram has used Google to post positive reviews of itself (family members, employees).  I can only surmise that similar violations have been made on TripAdvisor. Yet, TripAdvisor does not allow me to post anything about my month long experience with this ashram.  How does deliberately refusing to post negative reviews of a business help the public to \"make the most of every trip\"?   I will never again use TripAdvisor to advise me.

I have even offered to stop by the tripadvisors Needham office to meet with a manager.Continuing to reply to tripadvisor customer support to keep this issue open/unresolved is a waste of time particularly when I have received multiple different responses from tripadvisor customer support.12/20/17 Update. Sill no contact/update from tripadvisor!! When you report a problem with this company to this company they simply ignore the report. Remember when you see reviews at tripadvisor you cannot count on them since they only publish some and not all reviews submitted. Plus the idea that companies pay to be listed twice is outrageous and tripadvisor should have stopped the practice long ago. Any company that does not allow reviews of themselves on social media sites has much to hide!12/28/17-Still no update from Tripadvisor!! No surprise but since customer relations directed me back to the unresponsive Trip advisor support I thought I might hear something by now about the duplicate company post and the censorship of my reviews.Date of experience: December 12, 2017', 'date': 'December 21, 2017'}\n",
      "{'reviews': \"Tripadvisor is becoming uselessTripadvisor will never be better than the data input it gets from its users. It is therefore pretty useless in finding nice hotels or good restaurants.Cheap crappy hotels close to airports and far from city centers will get five star reviews, because some user was positively surprised that it was not worse than it was, and really nice hotels in the centers will get bad reviews because people will be critical of every small detail that didn't live up to their expectations. Try search for best restaurants in any major european city ; you will get a list of secondary turkish or greek restraurants or crappy tourist traps, rather than a list that can guide you to the nice restaurants you are looking for.The whole site is becomming less and less usefull.Date of experience: December 10, 2017\", 'date': 'US'}\n",
      "{'reviews': \"Favors the businesses over honestyTripAdvisor favors business over honesty. I have two experiences with this.First, I posted an honest review of a Jamaican hostel, the Bird's Nest - and TripAdvisor honored the request to remove it, even though it met guidelines. I even emailed the CEO as to why it was being removed, no answer.Finally, they allowed publication. But then, the owner of the hostel didn't meet the guidelines of relevancy - and I flagged it with TripAdvisor. They didn't honor my request. Not objective. Not fair.Second, I posted another review of a Japanese hostel, where my money was stolen and the owner of the hostel poorly managed it. I didn't have a TripAdvisor account at the time, but because it was over a year - TripAdvisor didn't publish it. You would think this is information that someone looking for a place would want to know about. Again, it favors businesses over honesty. TripAdvisor has to value honesty more.Date of experience: November 21, 2017\", 'date': '1 review'}\n",

I have heard that reviews are selective removed by this company and now that a review of mine was removed.  I am bothered by the accuracy of reviews and potential conflict of interest TripAdvisor may have!  TripAdvisor owns many other travel businesses.  My review that was removed concerned the unbearable timeshare sales of a resort.  My review was factual , no bad language and only good information to the consumer to help make good choices,  I was told I could not review timeshare sales and as a result my review was removed. Seems very odd.  Valuable information  was removed to potentially make a resort look good.  I noticed that the resort I reviewed had wonderful reviews and no reviews regarding their unbelievable and horrible timeshare practices. As a result selective reviews determined by TripAdvisor can be incomplete and misleading.

      "{'reviews': 'BEWARE...DO NOT BOOK THROUGH TRIPADVISORI\\'ve lost all and total respect for Tripadvisor.....DO NOT book anything through them! They are a total joke and scam artists, if there was a ZERO STAR that\\'s what I would give them as one star is being too generous. I booked a 3 nights stay at the W Hotel in Fort Lauderdale on AUG 9, 2017 it is now Aug 25, 2017 and I still have no booking with the W Hotel. Lucky for me I\\'m not going until September. My credit card was charged immediately however, and what they don\\'t tell you when booking with them is they are dealing with another third party who is also dealing with a 3rd third party if that makes any sense?Once the booking was complete I then got a confirmation from Cancelon, a company based in Europe somewhere. No where does it tell or warn customers of this when making your booking, you get that lovely little surprise after they take your money. I had never booked with Tripadvisor before but decided to give them a chance as I assumed they were a reputable company, WRONG! I travel a fair bit so when I saw the itinerary from Cancelon with there own reference number and not one from the W Hotel obviously that was a red flag as I had never heard of this company before. Therefore I called the hotel and no surprise, no booking? I now call Cancelon, they advise that it will take 2-3 days for the Hotel to get the booking in their system. 3 days go by, call them back.... Now its 10 days, call them back... I\\'m now advised that Cancelon takes the money but their \"supplier\" as they call it make the bookings and the supplier lost the paperwork for my room whatever that\\'s suppose to mean? He says he will resend and put a rush on it. I found that strange as the very first Cancelon Rep I spoke with who told me to give it 2-3 days had advised me that Cancelon had indeed received the final confirmation from the hotel and it shouldn\\'t be very long. Like how many third parties have to be involved in booking a 3 nights stay at a hotel? And these Cancelon Reps are giving me a different story every time I call, which as you can imagine only makes you feel all the more anxious than you already are at this point.....Like common Tripadvisor!!!Finally I call Tripadvisor... First guy I speak to tells me they probably won\\'t give you a hotel confirmation until Sep 18, 2017 as I can potentially cancel my reservation up until that date!? I said well Sir, first of all if I wanted to book a room last minute I would of done so. Further more I was not advised of any such thing when booking this room and how do you know my room category would even be still available by then? He tried telling me they never have issues with Cancelon, I said take a look at the reviews not too many happy endings to say the least. He says he understands and will call them and email or call me back. I wait a day, nothing! Call back.... second guy I speak to again says oh sorry let me call them and call you back. He calls them, gets the same run around as I did, at least this guy called me back this time but basically tells me Cancelon is working on it and there is not a whole lot more he can do on his end, you have to deal with Cancelon he tells me. Basically washing their hands of any responsibility with this booking they took, great customer service and great way to do business!! Guess I\\'m on my own to figure this out!!At this point I\\'m thinking I\\'m a victim of fraud..... So I made one last call to Cancelon today before calling my credit card company to report fraud, making this the 8th Rep I speak with in a 2 week period. He may of finally got this booked? I am awaiting confirmation from the W Hotel to see if this is true or was this was a just another story to get me off the phone and pass the buck off to the next agent for the next time I have to call? I finally may have my room booked? Guess I shall soon find out.......but at this point not going to hold my breath.Either way Awful Customer Service and Terrible Business Practices on both Tripadvisor and Cancelon\\'s part. What if people were booking this a week or so before they left on vacation? I\\'ll tell you now its not worth the stress or headache. Stay away from these companies. Planning a trip is suppose to be fun and easy and you won\\'t get that with them. its not worth the extra buck your trying to save trust me. After reading some other reviews I can clearly see I\\'m not alone, others who perhaps thought everything was legit with their bookings showed up at their hotel with no booking or had their bookings canceled a day before they were scheduled to leave.

The Bad - The TIles around tthe pool areas are dangerous when wet(not the Correct Tiles at all)- ateam doing digging at the Hotel Dolphin pool left a lot of debris, small piles of concrete at the pool Steps, ony after i pointed out that this should be Cordened Off , did they take any action, placing Yellow Tape over it.(Not a good Advert for Safety Precautions at all)3.The Very Very Ugly -  just after we arrived, we went for Dinner in the Main Restaurant, while carrying a plate of Food to my table , i slipped on (what can only be described as a gresy patch of Floor), both feet went up in the air, i landed on the Tile floor,hurt my left elbow, right ankle, when i got up I discovered my left wrist was deeply cut by the Plate, the waiters immediately bandaged my wrist and the Manager came over to see,Later while sitting in the Lobby bar the Manager insisted i see the Hotel Doctor ( and i use the word Doctor very loosely) he insisted i needed stitches , i maintained i did not as the wound was  gelling together ok , but against my wishes he put in the so called stitches, he seemed more interested in money matters than his Hippocratic Oath. he wanted me to go back the next day, i did not, to me he was a Veternarian, not a doctor??(he spent more time farfing about, than giving me Medical attention)On the day that we were leaving and checking Out, the Management of the Hotel tried to stick me with a bill for £250.00, I refused to pay it , as the Hotel was responsible for the accident i had and the Doctor put in stitches, i did not want or Need.One of the Managers tried to insist i pay this bill,even trying to rattle me by saying they would get the police , i told them no bother, its a civil matter , not a criminal one.They even took off the Transfer bus , my luggage and my partners who had no  connection with this and locked it in a storage room, again trying to rattle me.The General Manager got involved, and only when i got the Guest Relations Manager, who was in the doctors office with me , and confirmed with her that i did not want or need stitches , only then did the Management back down- and I DID NOT PAYAs the Transfer bus had now left without us, i insisted that the Hotel get and pay for a taxi to the Airport, after some more wrangling with themthey then agreed to do so, Where was the Thomas Cook Rep,? he was nowhere to be seen , did not appear and told me to sort it out myself, he was as much use as a 'Chocolate Teapot' totally useless!!!!This is not a good Advert for this Hotel and i would like to see (DIETER G.

Unfortunately, there is a snow storm coming and we received a lots of warning that this storm is really bad and it says there that around 8feet of snow will go down from a day and road will be impossible to use. So we decided to try to cancel it. The property owner told us that we can cancel due to bad weather condition but they cant cancel it for us because we made the reservation through tripadvisor. So we called them and they told us that they will contact the property owner and call us back after they talk to them. The calling  back and forth started at 8am until 8pm because the tripadvisor customer service keep lying to us. Telling us they will contact the property owner but they never did for first 4 calls. One excuses tripadvisor customer service says that the property owner doesn't answer but we called them and they said they never called them and even didnt leave voice mail. Tripadvisor cust. Serv. Told us too that we cannot cancel because the property owner doesn't want to but we called the property owner first and they told us we can. 10:30am tripadvisor told us their computer is not working, have to wait for 30 mins. We did and call them back. At 12:30pm, we call tripadvisor again and this time it changed, they said they will give us full refund as long as we will rent again within a month to the same house. It took us 3months to plan this trip and they wanted us to reserve in 1 month. We called the property owner and his answer changed too, he said that we need to reserve for a month or two and we asked if we can just pay for cancellation fee, he said yes, $250 will be the cancellation fee and we approced that but we have to talk again to tripadvisor to finalize everything but the tripadvisor doesn't want to let us go without taking a lot of money from us. Around 7pm, i called tripadvisor and asked for supervisor to help, finally someone answered and work on the issue and finally found a solution, she told me that tripadvisor and me will share for the charges and we wil get our refund in 3 business days. But but but..... it changed again, after waiting for the refund, 5 days had passed and i called them again and now they told me that they will send the case to the higher level. The higher level messages me after few days and told me that the property owner is now charging me $380 as a good will gesture and this is full and final settlement that they can only offer. I demanded an explanation on how and why it change but now, they refunded me only the deposit i made and not responding on me for 2 days already. I guess i will lose all my $640 for nothing.It just gives me a lot of stress, 2 weeks of stress.Trust me, it is not worth it. Just use airbnb or go directly to the hotel, cabins and rent there for a little much but saves you out of stress.I used cheapoair and i never get a problem getting refunds on cancellation.Date of experience: February 02, 2017\", 'date': 'Summary'}\n",

Because I value it's advise so highly, I also always contribute from my experiences, so that others can benefit.My only reservation, which grows over time, is that users need to learn how to interpret ratings and reviews. A humble sandwich bar or pizzeria with a handful of 5 star reviews can be ranked as a top eatery against restaurants with hundreds of reviews that may have a few negative reviews. It has taken me time to learn that many negative reviews result from some misunderstanding or technical problem that has little to do with the quality of the place. Understanding reviews in different languages can be very revealing. Some places clearly actively solicit reviews from patrons, so they get many more. All reviews are subjective. In general, people hold back from posting negative reviews (as I do), because even if my experience was not great, I don't necessarily want to harm a business.So a TripAdvisor rating is a very helpful guide, but ultimately the choice remains ours, as users, and we should use our own judgement, follow our instincts and perhaps take a chance on something new and different.Date of experience: December 01, 2016\", 'date': 'December 01, 2016'}\n",

They changed our Hotel a couple days before our trip to something not nearly as nice.We booked our room through tripadvisor.com with getaroom.com over a month in advance to get a good rate on a nice hotel.

They said that the hotel we booked was over sold and i'm still not sure why we were the people to get shafted out of all the guests. I called getaroom.com and tripadvisor.com and they offered me a refund but it was too late for us to try and find and book something different at a reasonable price. They said they had to find us something else with comparable rates but the problem is that all the rates are way higher if you try to book a nice hotel a couple days in advance, so all the hotels with comparable rates for a last second room are way lower quality. After being on the phone for over 3 hours I finally convinced them that this is completely wrong and comes across as a scam, and because I was very persistent they finally ended up finding us a better hotel. However, it is still further from the city, does not have a manhattan view and does not have a free shuttle. This all means we will be spending more money than planned and not enjoy our stay as much. They also waisted a bunch of my time on the phone/email and put us in a stressful situation right before our trip! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! They hook you with a good deal on a nice Hotel, then they try to put you in something inferior a couple days before your trip when its too late to book something else decent at a reasonable price.

      "{'reviews': \"I'm still waiting for my refundCurrently I have an unresolved case that dates back to the 24th January 2016, when I reserved a booking  for the amount of €102.14 through TripAdvisor. The booking was for an apartment that specified having 2 bathrooms, but later I discovered the advertised details for the property were not completely accurate; as only 1 bathroom was available. Initially when I contacted TripAdvisor Customer Support Team for a refund, I was advised that I would be fully reimbursed within 7-10 days, but after the 10th day the payment did not reach my account. When further contact was made with TripAdvisor in regards to my unpaid refund, I was told by a customer support assistant that my case could not be found. Imagine the additional upset and disappointment I had to endure, however this was just the beginning of my dissatisfaction with TripAdvisor.  After raising the case again with TripAdvisor, I found myself continuously chasing the support team for the progress of my refund. I often didn’t get an exact date for when I would receive my payment, and still today the 24th of July 2016 the refund date has not been confirmed. Ironically, on the 24 February I received an email from TripAdvisor claiming I have been refunded. Just when I thought there was a glimmer of hope in gaining my money back, sadly after 2 weeks there was no payment in my account. Furthermore, TripAdvisor was adamant the payment was made and insisted I should check with my bank. Despite informing TripAdvisor that I had already checked my online bank statement and seen no trace of a refund, and for the benefit of doubt I also visited my bank for a thorough overview of payments but to no avail, TripAdvisor then made an unreasonable request to be sent a copy of my bank statement. As a result of this, I was appalled that TripAdvisor disbelieved my claim in not getting refunded, and naturally I began to feel more suspicious about the intentions of TripAdvisor. Quite rightly I insisted that I was not sending a copy of my bank account statement, and demanded that proof of payment was instead sent to me. Eventually on the 1st April 2016, I received a confusing copy of receipt for a PayPal transaction denoting my “apparent” refund. Immediately I couldn’t understand why there was an attempt to refund me through Paypal, when my original payment for the booking was made directly via my credit card, furthermore I was shocked that the recipient’s PayPal account details had not matched my own account details. This evidently proved that it was impossible for me to receive a refund at all, and the fact that TripAdvisor did not return the funds straight to my credit card, had prompted more distaste in their failure to provide a loyal refund. Over 5 months have passed and I still have not received my refund. Through my most recent correspondence with TripAdvisor in May, I have been made aware by their Customer Relations Department that they are now investigating the case with their internal fraud department. In addition, I was told I would be contacted by an assistant to update me on the progress of the matter, but disappointingly over 4 weeks have elapsed and as usual TripAdvisor has not been in touch.I really can’t comprehend the agonising level of stress and inconvenience I have been put through for the sake of gaining my due refund. Irrespective of whether my refund may have been fraudulently handled by a member of the company, the unreasonable delay in receiving my money back should not continue. As mentioned, the reason I requested a refund was due to the fact that the property I had booked was “misrepresented” on TripAdvisor’s website. Certainly this issue is covered by the “Payment Protection Policy” that TripAdvisor clearly outlines in their terms under “4. Misrepresented Rental (i) you are unable to rent the Rental as intended;…” Here it makes apparent that my case for a refund is coherent to the details covered under TripAdvisor’s Policy. For TripAdvisor to further delay my refund is a clear breach of their Payment Protection contract to me as a “customer”. Throughout my ongoing experience with TripAdvisor, it makes me consider that this company has no regard for decent customer service, customer statutory rights or the terms of their own policy. No customer deserves to be treated this way for the sake of gaining their due refund. Again my question for TripAdvisor is, when will you refund the full amount of €102.14 back to my credit card? And to prevent more disappointment in this situation, do refrain from making my refund through PayPal; whereby it may again end up in an unknown account or incur admin charges that will hinder payment of the full amount. I look forward to receive my refund without any excuses otherwise I will not hesitate to present this case to the local Trading Standards. Also, you should realise that I am entitled to claim compensation for the unacceptable level of stress I have endured throughout this experience.Date of experience: July 26, 2016\", 'date': 'October 30, 2016'}\n",

      "{'reviews': 'Do not make a reservation through TripAdvisorI have always been a fan of TripAdvisor and found hotel and restaurant reviews to be extremely helpful.  I never thought to make a reservation through TripAdvisor but after searching for a hotel in Disney World on Kayak, the site redirected me to TripAdvisor.  TripAdvisor was advertising the Mystic Dunes Resort & Golf Club at $57/night which sounded almost too good to be true.  I actually went directly to the hotel\\'s site and everything seemed to add up.  I went ahead and booked it, bringing my total to approximately $311 for a 4 night stay.  TripAdvisor assures you upon booking that there are no hidden fees and the price you see will be the total cost of your trip.  Immediately following my booking, I received a confirmation email from Diamond Resorts (the parent company for Mystic Dunes).  This email stated that I booked at the \"AARP\" rate and had to show proof of membership at check-in.  It also stated that I would owe $142/night at check in (in addition to a $12/day resort fee + $100 security deposit).  I can understand the resort fee as I do work in the travel industry and security deposits are pretty standard.  That being said, it shouldn\\'t say \"no hidden fees\" at check out.  Regardless, I am not an AARP member and had booked the hotel for $57/night, not $142.  I immediately called TripAdvisor to clear up the mistake.  They assured me that I would not have to pay more than $311 and connected me to the reservations department for Diamond Resorts.  I forward my email to the woman and Diamond Resorts and she confirmed that it was a mistake.  However, my reservation had not gone through yet (it can take up to 48 hours) so she promised to follow up with me through email when it came through.  I just wanted to have everything in writing so there was no confusion at check-in.  48 hours went by and I never heard back.  Today (a week later), I called again.  They told me they had no record of my reservation and to call TripAdvisor.  The people at TripAdvisor then directed me back to the reservations department.  The reservations department then told me that when a reservation is booked through a third party, it goes directly to the front desk at the resort.  So, she connected me to the front desk at the resort.  The woman at the front desk told me I was misinformed and that the reservations department should be able to find that.  She checked anyway and could not find my reservation.  I then got redirected back to TripAdvisor.  I have spent over an hour and a half dealing with this today and still have no answers.  I have sent multiple emails to the email addresses given to me by people I spoke with and still haven\\'t heard back.  At this point, I just want to cancel the reservation and book elsewhere but can\\'t even seem to do that.

I had to pay for a rental in London up front the full amount plus £500 in damage deposit even before it was confirmed the property was available (In hindsight I should have smelled a rat at that point  -why would they need a damage deposit before the booking is actually confirmed !) The owner confirmed within a few hours by e mail in the \\'rental box\\' on the tripadvisor site that the property was NOT available  However tripadvisor refused to return any of my funds (not even the damage deposit ) for over a week and then only when I had spent a huge amount of time and effort  speaking to various disinterested and dishonest (\\'I promise the money will be returned tomorrow\" ) staff in tripadvisor call centres . Even trying to find a customer service number that is not a long call menu, eventually just telling you to contact the owner of the property, is almost impossible.Some of the reasons given for not returning my money were ludicrous  -one even said that the company had to run an internal audit before I could be allowed to get my funds released back to me.

I have taken many cruises, for example, where my party had a wonderful time, but there were still some very bad reviews, saying outrageous things like \"the cruise was a total disaster, a nightmare\". I know to expect that maybe 5% of people cannot be pleased no matter how well run the hotel/cruise/restaurant is.

Telemessos is a great hotel in Turkey with amazing, hardworking staff but it is very unfair why Turkish people and businesses having the be disadvantaged like this by omitting reviews. The staff were so happy when I promised them I would leave a positive review when I returned home. I can even prove my stay if Tripadvisor gave me the chance. It appears they are not as intelligent at detecting fraud if they have to filter genuine reviews like mine. It is crying shame how monopolies have formed on the web so people have few alternatives to compete with them due to prices or populatity in this case e.g. Ebay, PayPal, Trustpilot.

      "{'reviews': \"Tripadvisor needs to follow its own rules!!As a restaurant owner I have to say that I find Tripadvisor one massive pain in the backside.How can supposed customers be allowed to post reviews anonymously??I have had a couple of 2 star reviews from people and I questioned whether the actual visits even took place. I asked Tripadvisor to ask the customers to prove that they had visited our restaurant by showing their receipt. This was thrown out by Tripadvisor and I was told that the reviews would stand.One of the reviews I believe was written by a competitor actually had a photo of him. When I private messaged the individual, they subsequently removed their photo and replaced it with something else.There is a very simple way for Tripadvisor to become a level playing field.Customers should not be allowed an anonymous profile. The profile should be the persons full name and with a photo.Also, when people register to the site they should have to show identification, photo ID etc This way they would only be allowed one account.Not only this but when a restaurant questions whether the person has actually visited them, the customer should have to prove this by showing a receipt to Tripadvisor. If Tripadvisor followed these simple guidelines, it would create a level playing field.The way it is, it just isn't fair for restaurant owners.

After some extensive research of options I recognize it\\'s perhaps the most widely read platform, and it\\'s wildly popular with people from all over the world. Whereas other restaurant critic sites do just that - offer a space for diners to review restaurants - or are more country-focused, TripAdvisor has it all. I like that. I also like that it\\'s easy to navigate. What I like better about  some other review sites, however, is that you have to provide proof that you have actually dined at a particular place, or spent a night at a particular hotel. \\rWhat I also like from other sides is that I can write a critic every time I go - and that I do not have to wait for a month to continue writing. \\r At Tripadvisor, there\\'s certainly room for improvement. As it is, you recognize quantity not quality of critics. I can see why - it lowers the bar and encourages people to write even very brief remarks. And yet, why don\\'t you have a premium review site for more sophisticated, more indepth reviews? There sure must be an algorithm for that?\\r Another concern. At the level and rate I write I would think that it\\'d earn me more visibility as a rather proficient writer. It\\'s true that I\\'d still have to market my personal food blog more widely before jumping ship. Copy and paste is easy. However, I have a day job and I do the food-writing for fun also, yet on the flip side I\\'m producing benefit for TripAdvisor for free, raising the bar, and also for the restaurants I\\'m featuring (thank you for the occasional glass of wine). The way I write is that I focus on very good and outstanding dining experiences - so this is good marketing for a restaurant, also for restaurant week organizers. For me to voice a negative critic a place has to be exceptionally bad in food, service, and flair. I any case, whenever I write I intend to be as explicit, informed, and atmospheric as I can - as they say, I\\'m \"brutally honest\", in a good way. And you sure will never read from me that the food, or the wine, has been, well, \"yummy\".Date of experience: April 27, 2016', 'date': 'April 27, 2016'}\n",

In 2013, I did a Halong Bay cruise and put up a review but that was removed because the cruise company complained that my review was for 2 day/1 night cruise whereas ONLY reviews allowed were fr 1 day cruise.  Under this crazy pretext, my review was removed.  When I flagged several  2 day/1 night reviews, nothing ever happened to them - because I was NOT the company paying big bucks to TripAdvisor.  That was my first experience with TripAdvisor.  Recently, after an 8-day/7 night Pamir highway tour, I put up a review of that tour company and guess what - TripAdvisor is NOT publishing it.  I am sure TripAdvisor is likely negotiating a deal with that company structuring what can be reviewed so they can eliminate my review.

      "{'reviews': 'A big company with no ethical and no respect for the work of others!I have a three star business Hotel in Rome, and like all My colleague, when i opened 6 years ago at the same time was opened a profile on trip advisor without having received any request about my property. No problem about this, Tripadvisor is a wonderfull instrument and opportunity to sell and show our service to customers of all the World who want to arrive in Our beautiful City. So in only five Years My Hotel has reached 300# in ranking Hotel of 1.276 Hotels. \\rUp to now it is a beautiful story about a little Hotel (21 rooms in suburbia of Rome, versus a Big Chains of Hotels with 100 rooms in better areas and more budget to spend in web marketing than Us ), so proud and happy about our results we decide to reach the 100 # position and take more customers from TripAdvisor Users so we decide to invest our budget to buy the Tripadvisor \"Company Profile”, that your sellers proposed to us. So we became also a customer for TripAdvisor Company and i have started to pay this service, after 3 months i saw that in One month instead of growing Up, my Hotel  position went down of 150 positions in 1 Month!! I try to get information about this with Our Tripadvisor referent, and she has explained  to Us that The customer service have a suspicious, that is \"Our reviews could be not true\" beacause they have been written inside the Hotel (so with the same IP). OK now, all my work on Tripadvisor, my money which i have invested on Tripadvisor company was put in the trash because people during Their stay write some reviews inside my Hotel?! I have people that stay in my Hotel for business also for 3 months obsiuvly that if they wrote a review using our line and Our IP with Our wi-fi connection! So what stupid criterio is it, to be able to understand with review is true and wich false?! And again, if there is such a suspicious, I think it would be more correct to contact the hotel and ask about it. The hotel could of course answer that every clever man could  realize that 68 reviews in 5 years are very few to be false….don’t You think? But the most important thing is that through the italian office, you can\\'t resolve anything because they haven\\'t the instrument to resolve this situation. So The End of The story is that the Hotel became only a number and instead to grow Up was stopped without a right reason. Is not a good way to resolve the thing for a big company like Tripadvisor. Take care of the work of Other is a responsability if you are a big company like you are.\\r Valerio Tullo\\rHotel Darival Nomentana***Date of experience: April 11, 2016', 'date': '13 reviews'}\n",
      "{'reviews': 'A Word of Caution to TripAdvisor Travelers and HostsIt’s unfortunate that I have to write this review as I’m not one to write negative reviews towards businesses, but I felt obligated to surface the lack of compassion TripAdvisor has towards their guests. \\r Recently I had a single mom with two small children book our home for a family vacation at the beach. Unfortunately 3 weeks before their arrival the mom lost her job and could no longer afford taking her kids on vacation. Even though it was outside of the cancellation period I was happy to fully refund their money due to the circumstances. When I requested TripAdvisor to refund their deposit, the TripAdvisor team only provided a partial refund to the family and kept all the TripAdvisor booking fees (over $200). Their reason was “to cover the costs associated with processing reservations and running our site”. \\r Why can’t a large company like TripAdvisor make an exception and refund the money to a single mom and her children who clearly needed it? Is that $200 really needed by TripAdvisor to “cover the costs associated with processing reservations and running their site”? Making $200 on a single reservation when they book thousands per year is clearly more than enough to run their site. If I, the host who is actually lending out my home to others, can make an exception then I believe a large company like TripAdvisor can do the same. Other sites like AirBnB and HomeAway charge the guests much lower booking fees (~3%) and do well for themselves, so it’s difficult to understand why TripAdvisor must charge much higher booking fees (up to 15%) and don’t even have good customer service to justify the higher costs.\\r Unfortunately, after explaining the situation multiple times to the TripAdvisor team, they stood their ground and kept their $200. I was so disappointed in TripAdvisor’s lack of compassion in this situation that I removed my listings on TripAdvisor and now use AirBnB and VRBO, who have lower booking fees and infinitely better customer service and compassion towards others. \\r Travelers and hosts, if you’re considering booking or listing a home, consider sites like AirBnB or VRBO before TripAdvisor, who actually care for their guests and can support you with a positive customer service experience.Date of experience: March 19, 2016', 'date': 'Summary'}\n",

Back in November, I arranged to book a cabin in Santa Cruz, Sumana Cottage to be exact.  Money was transferred, numerous confirmations back and forth, right down to the cell number of the owner and the lock key number for the cabin.  Yesterday, at 10:30, the owner decided that he had double booked the cabin and cancelled our reservation.  As we were enroute from LA to Santa Cruz, we didn't receive it until he sent us a text at 12:30.  Imagine our dismay, traveling with our dog 1/2 way to Santa Cruz with no place to stay.  Needless to say, I cancelled and charged back our credit card immediately and we returned home, bitter as hell.  Now, allegedly, the owner of the cottage has tried repeatedly to contact Flipkey to let them know what happened so we aren't out of $ but according to him, they are not responding.  I haven't tried contacting them yet because I'm not able to do it without swearing, I just sic'ed Citibank on them.  Chargebacks are a pain.

      "{'reviews': 'Customer Support Service - Very Poor or non-existent!TripAdvisor (Holiday lettings - et al) are businesses that need to clean up their act! Even when you get a response from the customer service department it is curt and usually unhelpful.\\r When an email from ‘Customer Support’ arrives and you send a reply using the reference numbers given on their email, more often than not it is bounced back to you with the following message: “We are unable to find an existing open case for your account”. How can they lose their own reference numbers and e-mails? \\r Thus you are sent back to the starting gate, using their customer support form. Which for all the good it does, may not as well be on their site.\\r This is not how businesses should behave. The reason for this communication is that a traveller stayed in the property I manage, but I have not received payment!  (Booking ref BR17732554)\\r Unfortunately the Holiday Letting - Trip Advisor systems took two payments from the traveller’s bank account on the 18th August which was 31 days before the guest arrived at the property. Holiday lettings and payment processing company ‘Pay Pal’ messed it up!  This has never been explained by HL/TA or PayPal to me or the traveller!  \\r The traveller’s bank confirmed that one payment was received by Holiday lettings (TripAdvisor) and that the second transaction was refunded to the travellers account. \\r Holiday letting received payment for the booking a month in advance, they have now had the money for the booking for over 122 days (and counting). I have been out of pocket for 90 days (and counting).\\rAt NO TIME has HL/TA/PayPal contacted the traveller to clarify the situation. They have acquired payment for the travellers stay but have not released it to the intended recipient. \\r At this moment in time it feels to that I have been mugged and I cannot do anything about it. It would be nice to know who can take action against such businesses that hide behind technology and very poor service! They obviously do not want to hear about their failures, and seem quite prepared to ignore the property owners and travellers when things go wrong with their own systems.\\r Holiday lettings –TA etc. make a big thing about payment protection for the traveller, but there is no mention of payment protection for the property owners or the traveller that they are supposed to serve when there systems break down or make fraudulent transactions!\\r While I may not get the payment due to me, at least I can let others know that these organisations are a law unto themselves.

TripAdvisor allows me to research and plan my travels in a manner that has, so far, reduced disappointment to almost zero on many trips whether it be a place to stay, sights to see, places to eat, attractions to visit, etc. But the lack of BS hype is what brings me back to TripAdvisor and the opportunity to leverages the experience of others at a grand scale is priceless. \\r I should say however that one must read multiple reviews of an attraction or location as, well to put it frankly, some people are just ridiculous in terms of what they may expect.

In December, after 3 days of trying to make a booking through their rentals, and being told that they systems were down and they would get back to me, but never did, I finally was able to make a booking... It turned out it was systems, it had to do with my card they didn\\'t like, but hours on the phone waiting for their customer service didn\\'t tell me that, I just tried another card.  So, nothing to do with their systems.  Then, the total quoted/ shown was $762.75, with $675 for the rental and the remaining 87.75 for a booking fee, which is explained as: \"With this fee you are covered by the Peace of Mind Protection. Learn more. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total reservation cost, not including refundable security deposit, deposit insurance, and owner-specified taxes.\"\\r  But then, when I went to make a payment the total was $797.74. This had happened each time I tried to make the booking and it didn\\'t appear to be that the price had gone up.. I.e. the price for the rental and the price for the booking fee were still the same.  There was just a different total.  So, because it was very late in the day as our booking was for Xmas-NY and I had already had several difficulties in interacting with them, and I went ahead and paid the $797.74.  Then, I immediately sent an email asking for explanation of the difference, and asking why I was forced into paying for payment protection/ insurance under \\'booking fee\\', when I didn\\'t require it.  \\r This is the first response I received:\\r \"Hi,\\rThank you for your message. The booking fee is not optional. It is the service charge to use our site which covers the credit card processing fee among other fees. The total cost for this rental is $797.74. If you\\'ll notice on the screen shot you sent, it is displaying the amount in GBP. Unfortunately, we are not able to control to exchange rate. I apologize for any confusion.\"\\r Hmmm... so to the first point, why do they say that it\\'s for payment protection/insurance and then say it\\'s for credit card processing?  13% seems a lot for such costs as per the email, and is a lot on top of the rental fee.\\r On the second point, I responded the next day: \"Hi - thank you for your response but I\\'m afraid I don\\'t understand. The fact that there is an amount in Sterling that corresponds to the total [of 762.75] does not have any bearing the dollar amount. You still have not t explained why there are 2 different dollar totals. Thank you\"\\r Eight days later, I was told that the issue had been escalated.  13 days after that I got received the following 2 messages within 2 mins of each other:\\r \"Hi Rachel,\\rI wanted to check in with you to find out if you have heard from the owner. We instructed him to communicate with you directly to arrange the refund.\"\\r then\\r\"Hi Rachel,\\r Please disregard the previous message. It was sent in error.

The major selling points of having organic, user based, reviews -- Trip Advisor (TA) does a pretty good job.  However they fall short in having a checks-and-balence system in knowing whether or not a contributor was actually where they said they were.  Booking, Despagar, etc, they have ways to verify that guest actually stayed at hotel, whereas TA relies on integrity.  In mass, this has only so much effectiveness.  I'm a fan of how TA sources flights under one umbrella -- this umbrella, however, could be bigger.  Considering the global nature of the webpage, it should tap into lesser known resources like despagar (Latin America's discount flight, hotel, rent-a-car provider), Decolar (the Brazilian Portuguese version of the same thing) and country and regionally specific airlines like TAM, AVIANCA, etc.  Their offline downloadable city guides are helpful.Date of experience: March 16, 2015\", 'date': '6 reviews'}\n",

I think the one tip I can offer review readers is to read as many reviews about a particular venue as possible, not just the first one or two. What I have noted is that any traveler can have a \"bad day\", and that can earn a poor review for a hotel, restaurant, etc. when it might not be warranted. This can become obvious when you read reviews that are heavily 4 and 5-stars, yet there are a couple of 1-star reviews at the other extreme. We can all have a bad day, so just go into reading reviews with this tip in mind. At the same time, don\\'t be unfairly swayed by gushing 5-star reviews, either. \\r      As a reviewer, try to add something that hasn\\'t already been mentioned by previous reviewers, and of course, be honest.

      "{'reviews': \"Most Reliable Travel ReviewsI base my engagement with venues now more on TripAdvisor than anything else.  I have found lodging and dining reviews on TripAdvisor to be much more reliable and true to reality than anything in travel books.  I'm guessing some places pay the travel books to list their establishment.  I'll use the books to get an idea of where I want to stay or go or eat, but I never book or go to anything without checking TripAdvisor reviews first.  I have gone to some top pick places in travel books, even with less than stellar TripAdvisor reviews, and always regretted it, finding the reviews on TripAdvisor were spot on.  \\r There are only two things I would change to make TripAdvisor even more valuable, at least for me.  I would adjust the 'traveling with' selections to distinguish between Family with children and Family without.  I always want to see reviews from Families to see how family-friendly a place is, but often, especially with lodging, the Family reviews were people there for a family reunion or wedding or something.  I don't necessarily get a sense of how good the place is for people with children.  So, a classification of Family with young children and Family with teen children would be helpful.  The other thing I would add to the dining reviews is a way to indicate a restaurant with healthy or organic options.  More and more people are trying to eat that way and it is hard to know unless you happen upon a review where someone specifically calls it out.  I now try to incorporate it in my review titles, but that doesn't help me necessarily.Date of experience: March 13, 2015\", 'date': '4 reviews'}\n",

      "{'reviews': \"Never Book a Room without Reading TripAdvisor ReviewsI travel all over the world on business and I use several different search companies so I know I am getting a good rate when I book the room direct with the hotel, but I NEVER book without reading the TripAdvisor reviews.\\r My trip in a few weeks it to Masstricht, Holland and I had planned to stay at the usual chain I book with and have rated very well with several trips. The location in Masstricht showed a 4 Star rating and its a large, well known brand. After reading the reviews I quickly clicked off the site and went to an independent hotel - Actually, it a castle I will be staying at and I booked a great room for the same price as a club level at the other place.\\r On reading reviews, I can understand some people have a bad day, some people can't be pleased. So on negative comments I take them in stride, look to see if the writer has posted several comments, or just likes to complain online to feel like a big shot. But when I see numerous negative comments ie: Musty smell, outdated,  filthy carpet, not friendly to gold/platinum level members... I take notice and will search elsewhere.\\r I find the rating comments to be far more reliable than the STAR rating a hotel is giving themselves. I had one manager upset that I gave them 3 stars.  I advised him to go stay at the Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong or the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs and see  what rating he would give his place and that I felt the 3 stars was generous. I try to rate my hotels in their class and separate Resort class from Flop House class so people understand that its OK for that class of hotel chain. \\r I also read reviews to see what is around the hotel for after hours entertainment - coffee shops, junk stores, places to eat, distance to city center, train depot...

They call it safe way- think for yourself for whom it is safe and profitable. Pay after arrival and if it is not possible, seek other accommodation (that was advice from their support desk 1 day before my departure, when money for my hotel in London were still on their account!)\\r-do not bother with this insurance- it is worthless- they said it covers up to 10.000 $ but just try to get something of cost you paid (actually they should also give me back money for my hotel- it was much more than cost of this apartment)Date of experience: May 12, 2014', 'date': 'US'}\n",

The reviewer only has 1 or 2 previous reviews and maybe no (or 1-2) forum posts and says generic things.  If I see too many of this type of review for an establishment, I don\\'t trust their ranking. It makes me question whether or not they are paying people to write reviews for them (I\\'ve read that reviews can be \"bought\").  So, all in all, I still view tripadvisor to be a valuable resource but at time I am suspicious of the authenticity of some of the reviews.Date of experience: January 17, 2014', 'date': 'US'}\n",

There is a great lack of anyone at the corporate level getting involved in what is posted.\\r Anyone could start a website that would be more beneficial for the traveler if they included an area that shows the hotels that did not respond to a complaint. \\r Responding to someone saying the hotel is great does not mean anything. Fixing a problem a guest had means something. Honoring a reservation means something. \\r It would be more beneficial to be able to look up complaints against an entire chain of hotels instead of trying to scroll through message after message at a single hotel in a particular city. \\r Now that gives me an idea for a website. A website for complaints that hotels don't answer or correct.Date of experience: January 17, 2014\", 'date': 'January 17, 2014'}\n",

I was not allowed to rebut the false statements, just the owner rebuttal while correct is usually viewed as self-serving. \\rI understand that everyone has an opinion but when just one goes that much against the opinion of every other poster it must be suspect.

      "{'reviews': 'Good, Bad and UglyFirstly our qualifications:\\rWe are a couple in our 60\\'s and have travelled extensively over all continents except eastern Europe over a period of 45 years. We currently own an accommodation property that enjoys a number rating from TA clients for our area. We use the TA app and TA website extensively for accommodation and restaurants when we travel AFTER selecting a short list from other direct booking websites or google searches.\\rThe Good: TA is a great tool for generally qualifying and comparing a selection of options for accommodation or restaurants. Typically we only look at places that have over 50 reviews so we can see a balance of opinion - every place has a few bad reviews and it is not hard to see where the upset customer is coming from, HOWEVER, if you then go and look at THAT Reviewers OTHER reviews (by clicking on their review list) it is sometimes easier to see why they are generally disgruntled or if they fall into the basket of \"impossible to please\". E.g if you are a top spender and book 5 star properties and then stay at a 4 star property and complain about no room service 24x7 then that review is clearly out of context. Similarly if you are typically on a $100/night accommodation  budget and check in at a 4 star property you will question where the value for money is and probably this will be reflected in your overall review. A simple rule should be.......Keep your review in context of what you have actually booked - not what you thought you were booking!\\rThe Bad: TA does not have the time to moderate or arbitrate on reviews - they have become too big and anonymous to address the detail. MANY owners of restaurants and accommodation take the time to respond to some or all reviews yet when something is clearly incorrect it is almost impossible to find someone at TA who will take the decision to remove the review. Even with a business listing and a regional coordinator they will seldom pay any attention to the listees concerns except when it is time to collect the annual licence fee!\\rThe Ugly:  Bribery for good reviews is subtle yet rife in the accommodation industry. Clients are enticed with gifts for writing a review such as bottles of wine and one place in our region  sits their clients down with iPad\\'s already opened on a Facebook and TA review page and offers the clients a glass of champagne to sit down and write a review primarily of Facebook but also on TA while staying with them. Needless to say their TA rating is a high one! The hints are there in the average and poor reviews if you read them - which are of course vigorously denied and defended/apologised for in the respective management responses.\\rSo where to from here? The missing link is that clients tend to use TA as an adjudicator for final selection but 90% of them never properly read the property\\'s own website or the detail on the direct booking website in the first place. This is why most management will respond to TA reviews but NOT to reviews posted on direct booking websites where the booking was made. As experienced travellers AND owners of a top TA rated property we would suggest the following procedure:\\r1. Search for your accommodation/restaurant via google or your favourite booking website\\r2. From your short list get an overall feeling from TA reviews as to whether the products will match your expectations\\r3. Go back to the direct booking websites and read the detail thoroughly\\r4. If in doubt - phone the operator and ask for clarification of your concerns and SAY to them - as I read on TA!\\r5. Whatever your experience be sure to confront the issues (not your emotions) with the proprietors and if you write a review make it fair and in the correct context.\\rGood luck and safe travels.Date of experience: January 16, 2014', 'date': '3 reviews'}\n",

While the quality and quantity of the reviews varies dramatically, in general, it is fairly easy to get a general idea and feel for a location, restaurant, hotel, etc.  When there are multiple reviews, it is clearly easier to discern whether there is bias, or whether the reviews generally seem objective.  There are likely some areas for improvement - especially within the accuracy area.  Without question, such sites will always attract some level of people trying to \"game\" the system, but typically, most reviews seem genuine.  If one looks hard enough, there appear to be examples of manipulated reviews, or likely \"pay for review\" type of hyperbole that makes no sense for the establishment being reviewed.  However, it is the exception rather than the rule.  The other area I think which would help, is for accuracy of some of the locations.  Occasionally some of the information is dated.

The itinerary described on your website clearly states:\"Start your journey with a refreshing swim in a cool pool, perfect for unwinding and recharging. Then, gear up for an exhilarating quad biking experience across the rugged terrain of the Atlas Mountains, complete with safety equipment and guidance from a professional instructor.\"After the quad biking, the description mentions a camel ride, which is fine. However, the actual sequence of events was entirely different:Quad biking – This was done first, under extremely high temperatures, making it uncomfortable.Camel ride – Again, in unbearable heat.Swimming pool – Instead of being the refreshing start to the experience, we were taken to the pool at the very end of the tour, just as the sun was setting. Not only was the timing completely impractical, but we were also not allowed to swim. Neither my partner nor the French family accompanying us were permitted to use the pool, despite it being a key part of the package. When we complained, the staff simply told us they \"couldn\\'t do anything about it.\" I have photographic evidence showing the time we arrived at the pool, confirming this issue.Additionally, when booking, we were given the option to choose between a French or English-speaking guide. We specifically selected English. However, neither the quad biking guides nor the camel ride guides spoke English. We had to rely on the French family to translate for us, which is completely unacceptable—especially when riding a quad bike in the desert, where clear instructions are crucial for safety.When I raised this complaint through TripAdvisor, I received the following response from Viator:\"We did not include in the description that the pool will be heated; it’s winter, so it’s typical for the water to be cold.\"At no point in my complaint did I say that the pool was cold or that I expected it to be heated. My issue was that we were not allowed to swim at all, despite it being part of the itinerary. This response completely ignores the actual complaint.After that, I received another response stating:\"As part of this review, we investigated all materials and pertinent information including (but not limited to) the product details on the tour page, your ticket, and any communications regarding this booking. Based on all available information, we regret to inform you that we are unable to issue a refund for this booking.\"This so-called investigation was done without even requesting the photo evidence I offered to provide. How can you claim to have reviewed all available information without even considering the proof I have?I expect a proper resolution to this issue. At the very least, I request a partial refund for the experience not being delivered as advertised. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter further.Looking forward to a prompt and reasonable response.Date of experience: February 14, 2025',\n",

What is also very concerning is we have been making contact with Big Motoring World for last 2 weeks, and spoken to several advisors from Charlie, Richard, Lilly, Jordan, Jessica and Jack and not one of them have been proactive with resolving this or directing me through to senior management who can help. I called Auto Protect and they informed me within minutes I have no protection or even had a policy, which was confirmed via email (as mentioned please see below). Therefore I am struggling to understand why Big Motoring World, is still pending a reply from Auto Protect, in addition to understanding the stall tactic driven by yourselves. This situation has been prolonged for an unacceptable amount of time, without any resolution, which is very concerning, thereby leading me to believe that there is no genuine interest to resolve this issue. \\xa0This situation is extremely frustrating, I have been provided a very poor service, I have essentially been mis-led and mis-sold a service, no one is taking ownership and accountability for this situation. And as advised to all colleagues I want a refund for a service you failed to provide. For your transparency, I have involved the Ombudsman as I would like prompt resolution. \\xa0I look forward to your response and a swift resolution to this matter.Date of experience: February 07, 2025',\n",

This happened twice and the holidays were still being advertised for the original price on the website, I’ve been advised to speak to their customer service to rebook but looking at the alternative suggestions they’ve provided over email the newly proposed holidays are all much higher than what they have on their website, it feels as though they want you to ring so they can pressure sell you an equally expensive new holiday.

I have left reviews on Trip Advisor for years, but if I could leave one for Trip Advisor itself, I\\'d title the review \"BEWARE of Trip REVISER.\" Repeat after me: \"I will never book a hotel reservation through Trip Advisor again.\"  I booked an expensive \"Deluxe Ocean View Room\" at the Shangri-La Hotel in Boracay and when I check with the resort, they had reserved a lower tier \"Garden View\" room instead and without telling me.  The Trip Advisor app continued to show \"Deluxe Ocean View Room.\"  I discovered the matter by calling the Shangri-La Hotel myself.  When I brought this to the attention of Trip Advisor, they acknowledged the mistake (after 48 hrs.) but were unable to do anything to fix it.  They chalked it up to a \"mis-mapping\" in their reservation system.  In the end, they gave us a 10% refund but that did not change the fact that by the time all of this came to light, there were no more \"ocean view rooms\\' available at the Shangri-La Hotel.

I have been informed that said activities is done by Trip.com repeatedly and have been causing negative impressions.  To shed some light on; Trip.com charges customers for higher rate/better rooms.But in reality it actually reserved lower rate rooms.  So when customers showed up, they realised that rooms are not as expected.  (Put yourself in the shoes of someone who had been on a 18 hours flight {excluding transit time}, stepped into the room that much inferior to which they paid for and the reserved customer is a registered disabled individual!

So basically it negatively impacted financially to us (Paying extra to the hotel for the already paid room through Trip.com.  It would had been cheaper and less stressful of course if the reservation was done directly through the hotel’s website.) even though it was not customers’ fault nor the hotel’s.

Tripadvisor shares experiences via service providers that are unwilling, inept or unprofessional in meeting basic customer standards. These service providers never answer their office number, can never provide accurate details or appear to just scam people into paying $ for an experience that doesn’t justify the cost. Regrettably, some of these service providers are foreign nationals living abroad hence have no real experience of what basic customer standards mean to a tourist. I lost probably >$350 in one trip due to inefficiencies in meeting processes, basic directions, taxi fares and re-booked tickets. Oh, and if you try to claim a refund where the service provider made the mistake, just forget it. Tripadvisor (Viator - or whatever you are called) will never refund your $ paid.

Their boat trip to the Blue Lagoon that I went on yesterday was badly organized. Hundreds of passengers were left stranded on steep rocks waiting to board a boat while hundreds of other passengers  disembarked from it. It took them along time because the territory was rocky and quite steep . Old ,disabled and children  had to stand for an hour on the rocks with no shade and then  had to climb down  without assistance . It was extremely crowded in a very small and steep space and people were waiting stacked up on uneven ledges . People were not told ahead of time that conditions were not suitable for everyone. When I called the company to report this the agent argued back and didn't take the complaint seriously. I was helped on the rocks by kind strangers and an employee who said it wasn't her job to help. People were complaining about the conditions and said they will never use this company again.Date of experience: August 16, 2024\",\n",

Tripadvisor/Viator doesn’t recognise the issue with the tour guide not speaking english or that their app fails to mention there will be multiple guides, they also fail to recognise the reason I cancelled was due to Spanish tour guide and the Spanish wording in the tour app description which at that moment made me believe a mistake had been made on their end. The tour booking advises look for a \"tour guide\" with black umbrella however after speaking to their customer service team via email they later informed me there were multiple tour guides in the area with black umbrellas, their argument is I should have asked the Spanish tour guide, look the guy was speaking a different language and was engaged in a conversation with all the other Spanish speaking tourists, I don\\'t speak Spanish and as a paying customer don\\'t feel I needed to confront the guide, the app said look for the tour guide, we could only see one 1 with black umbrella so why would be dispute this? Perhaps the tour booking should have been clearer that there would be multiple guides in the area with black umbrellas and to find the one that speaks your language. The whole experience left me confused and my thought process was that something had gone wrong on their end. They now flat out refuse to provide me with a full refund.  I’m a valuable customer who has paid Viator over £300 on other tours during our stay in Edinburgh excluding this one but they prefer to hold onto small change and lose me forever and my future business. To top it off they called me to discuss complaint today not on the day I requested, the call lasted 45 minutes but the manager I was speaking to couldn\\'t care less, they wouldn\\'t see it from a human perspective and why the chain of events led me to cancel, instead the managers \"computer says no\" perspective wasn\\'t helpful and spoke over me multiple times, very poor service from Viator and Tripadvisor, vague descriptions on the tour app and poor resolution offered by a supposed manager. I won\\'t be using the trip Advisor app or Viator again unless I\\'m offered an acceptable resolution, I suggest you think hard before giving these guys your money.

We ordered a delivey from Al Ba Dar midland road Bedford. I've always used them in the past so whilst at a family members home we decided to have an Indian takeaway. I recommended this company only to be totally embarrassed. The food order was incomplete. The korma only had 5 small bits of chicken, they didn't supply the rice or salad acompliment as requested. Also the keema curry the container was only half full and they didn't supply the salad ordered with it and the biriani only had 5 bits of chicken in it. We called to ask where the rice and salad for our meals were as the uba eats man road away and we were told by Aldadar it's not their problem. Then a different man can on the phone saying he doest speak English and he put the phone down we called back to be told the manager would call us back. A different person said to call back at 5pm today and they would replace the meal. That was last night we called back to day and the staff keep putting the phone down on us and really do not care that they took Our £40 and now we keep calling them they keep hanging up. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. THEY GIVE HALF PORTIONS AND TAKE YOU MONEY BUT ONLY DELIVER HALF OF WHAT YOU ORDERED. This company really don't care about you as a customer they at 1npoint told us to track down the uber driver as it was his fault. We have called them 6 times and have bee told the manager will get back to us but he never has and when you call In the staff just hang up on you. I think we will have to get into the car and go down there as we have their curry they can have it back and we want our money back. This company needs to be closed down. Going to contact health and safety also as the children ate the korma and both are not feeling good today. Such an embarassmentFor us too.

To address the first, Tripadvisor does not tell users why their review was removed, claiming that the process is \"proprietary.\" On the second, Tripadvisor hides behind the reviews being free while conveniently ignoring the fact that businesses can indeed pay for additional services.

We only noticed the attempt to covertly get us to sign away our rights when they asked us to sign the \"voucher\", which made us suspicious and prompted us to read the following small print:\"This certificate is received as compensation for any inconveniences experienced during the recipient\\'s stay at our resort. This compensation is accepted by the guest with complete satisfaction and exempts The Excellence Collection and any other company related to the booking of your trip from all future claims or responsibilities. The recipient of this certificate agrees to not disclose the terms of this form of release, any statement, photo, or other information relating to the incident on social media. Failure to comply with this non-disclosure agreement will be deemed a breach of this settlement\".We considered this a very serious matter and raised it with the hotel after the stay but they were uninterested in taking any responsibility for this poor business practice, which is also directly in breach of Tripadvisor\\'s guidelines for hotels (i.e. manipulation of reviews by having guests sign confidentiality agreements to not post about negative experiences).Unfortunately, my review was wrongly taken down by Tripadvisor, despite not breaching any guidelines and it appears my entire account has now been flagged so any review I write is automatically removed. This means that the reviewing system is completely skewed. I also notified Tripadvisor of a practice at the hotel whereby employees pressure guests into scanning a QR code to give a 5 star review and mention the employee by name. Again, Tripadvisor doesn\\'t seem to care about this manipulative practice.When I have tried to contact Tripadvisor customer service, all I get is a copy and paste \"computer says no\" response and absolutely no inclination on Tripadvisor\\'s behalf to actually engage on these serious issues.Update following Tripadvisor response on 31 October: This is an identical copy and paste response to those already received from your customer services team and does not actually address the issues noted in the review. It also does nothing to address the points around managing manipulation by the hotel in question by silencing guests with negative experiences through routine use of NDAs which are disguised as free upgrade vouchers and through their practice of pressuring guests into leaving 5 star reviews by scanning QR codes while they are trying to enjoy their holiday.Date of experience: October 30, 2023',\n",

I took the time to craft a detailed review, highlighting both the positives and negatives of my stay. But to my dismay, TripAdvisor repeatedly deleted my review without any valid reason or explanation.I believe in the power of transparency and honesty when it comes to sharing feedback about places we visit. By suppressing my review, TripAdvisor is denying potential guests the opportunity to be fully informed about the hotel's real conditions and service quality.This act of censorship makes me question the credibility of TripAdvisor as a reliable platform for unbiased reviews. I expected a fair and open space where travelers could freely express their opinions, but this ordeal has shattered that belief.I urge TripAdvisor to uphold the principles of transparency and not restrict users from sharing their genuine experiences. As consumers, we deserve the right to make informed choices when planning our trips.Until TripAdvisor addresses this issue and ensures that all users can express their honest opinions without fear of censorship, I cannot in good conscience recommend using this platform.

With the steady stream of traffic and one-way bridges, I would not have enjoyed it as much if I had been driving.   This Tripadvisor Small Group Tour had just 8 of us in a van and was described as driving from Kahului along the Road to Hana and then circling back across the mid-section of that part of Maui back to Kahului.  However, they had a severe winter storm that took out a bridge so we could not circle back, but had to come back on the same road to Hana with the 941 curves – we survived the curves on the road to Hana twice!!!We stopped at the famous Ho`okipa Beach Park and saw honu, Hawaiian sea turtles, basking on the beach below.  Our guide brought banana, pineapple, and papaya bread, and fresh pineapple plus water as a snack that we had here.  As our 70 year old German driver continued, he told about himself and the history of Maui and how Hawaii became a territory of the USA and then a state.  His talk about his past and his personal life seemed too embellished, and so I felt this was a 4.5 star tour.  However, he did give us interesting information about places and history for the 9 hours we were with him.  Our driver drove very slowly past several waterfalls where there really wasn’t any place to park.  We stopped at the Keanae Point lookout to see the peninsula which was created by an old lava flow, making for a very rugged beach.  We also stopped at Pua‘a Kaa Wayside Park where we walked up the paved trail to a lookout over a waterfall.  We stopped for lunch at a red sand beach near Koki Beach with the famous huli huli chicken.  On the way back, we stopped at Honokalani Beach - a gorgeous black sand beach at Waianapanapa State Park.  We also stopped at a lava tube and walked under what looked like tree roots into the tube and exited on the other side also surrounded by tree roots.  After a quick ice cream stop, we made one last stop for a quick and pleasant walk through a bamboo forest.

Very frustrating and time wasting. Also I didn\\'t notice any price benefit in prebooking. Consider the above with an hour of our travel to P&R site from outside Amsterdam, then an hour in Metro to the City Cantre, then 1/2 hour to find where they are located, the various parking prices paid and the inconvenience, certainly not befitting of a place like Amsterdam. Hardly any signposting at all after getting off Metro. Been to so many other European cities for such tours, never had a major problem. Due to all above, we completely missed our pre-paid bus tour.

The algorithm function is unreliable at identifying fake reviews and TA only has 300 agents to vet 7 million posts. Clearly, that\\'s not enough so fake reviews slip by on both sides of the fence. We went from an average of 15 bookings per month to 0 bookings from the end of April until July (we still have no bookings) because of the fakes. We hope that our business will recuperate from the damage. That remains to be seen.I advise any supplier who is being defamed by fake reviews follow all of TA\\'s procedures and consistently stay in contact. The thing that actually worked for me was this review on Trustpilot. Until I posted here I only got the run around.Following is my original review:My husband and I  are dependent on TripAdvisor reviews. We went from being a 5 star business over a period of 3 years to being completely shut down overnight by fake reviews created by a psychopath proven to be focused on destroying our business. After unsuccessfully using all of TripAdvisor\\'s suggested methods for reporting and removing fake reviews, we contacted TripAdvisor CEO Matt Goldberg directly, also to no avail. We sent him \"concise and informative\" documentation of all evidence of criminal behavior by this psychopath including proof of the FBI investigation, the restraining order and copies of social media threats to destroy our business as well as threats of violence by the perpetrator.We filled out and submitted TripAdvisor\\'s \"Content Integrity\" form. We showed that all of the fake i.d.\\'s created to allow the perpetrator to make fake reviews happened within a time period of less than 30 days. We even showed that during the month of May when the perpetrator claimed to have taken our tour - we had NO BOOKINGS!TripAdvisor has allowed the fake reviews to remain (6 fake reviews one directly after another - and counting) and removed our replies showing that the reviews were in question and being investigated by TripAdvisor.  After contacting Matt Goldberg, CEO we received a letter saying that TripAdvisor detected no suspicious activity. Our responses were again removed and we have had to answer each attack (multiple times) as if it was a real customer in order for our account to remain open. We have taken legal action against this psychopath. However, in the meantime our business is shut down and the 40% commission we have been paying to TripAdvisor means absolutely nothing, because TA has aided this psychopath in the ruination of our business by continuing to publicize the fake reviews to all of their constituents i.e. Bokun, Cruise Critic, FlipKey, The Fork, Holiday Lettings, Housetrip, Jetsetter, Niumba, SeatGuru, Viator... We have had no tours since May 1st, 2023 and the fake reviews keep coming. Although we have no bookings TripAdvisor still accepts the reviews as legitimate.Clearly, TripAdvisor\\'s policy of \"Content Integrity\" is not meant to protect suppliers.Date of experience: June 06, 2023',\n",

I posted the same review again on the Tripadvisor website, again the same response, and after the third time when I left a review and received the same email asking me to reconsider, I gave up because it is obvious that it is a scam company that publishes fake reviews according to how much some company wants to pay to get the best (fake) ratings. The last two negative ratings were published in 2019 and 2020, after that (after bribery) the Verde on Smith restaurant received only the best ratings.

If you look at many (if not most) travel businesses in, to name a few, Mexico, Morocco or Egypt you will realise most of their reviews are 5*, fake, and written by posters who have only written 1 or 2 other contributions. They will sometimes even include photos supplied by the company itself.Tripadvisor claims they have a zero tolerance approach to this, but they clearly happily tolerate it, especially from businesses who sell their products directly through them, earning them commission. The \"report a review\" button is completely pointless and nothing happens.I can only recommend being very very careful about highly rated businesses and check who has written their reviews. Always look at the more negative ones too - if someone who has written 300+ reviews was unhappy, that is probably a good indication of how that travel business actually operates.Edit: see their reply below - completely ignoring the issues and pretending they gain nothing from positive reviews - what a farce!Date of experience: April 12, 2023',\n",

I mistakenly thought that booking through a TripAdvisor website that they would only have companies with good reputations on their website. However, this is certainly not the case. We were lulled into a false sense of security by this, and we booked flights through a company on the website called Globehunters. Firstly, they tried to charge extra for luggage. Premium Economy flights usually come with two checked baggage included. They seem to just try it on. Their Customer Service is very poor. I then selected our seats the same day of booking. Yesterday I thought I would input our passport information, but could not access our booking with the reference number we had so, my husband had to call them today to get a booking reference that worked. He was given another booking reference, but was told that if we wanted this to enable us to select our seats we shouldn’t bother as this would change. My husband didn’t challenge this at the time because we had already chosen our seats. However, I went into our booking only to find that we had no seats selected. I found out by calling Virgin that the problem is because Globehunters have not issued our tickets yet. They advised calling to get these issued. I called Globehunters and explained what I was calling for and the person I spoke to cut the call. I called back and expressed how unprofessional this was. No apology was offered. I explained that I had spoken to Virgin and they told me I should ask for our tickets to be issued to enable us to choose our seats, as there are now only limited seats left.  I was told that  our tickets would be issued next week. Should I believe this?  I have also since seen awful reviews of Globehunters. TripAdvisor should be ashamed at recommending such companies to people. I’m amazed that TripAdvisor are willing to trade their reputation to support this unethical company. I guess it comes down to the commission they receive, which takes precedence over ethics. Shame!!!Date of experience: March 15, 2023',\n",

       " {'reviews': \"Fraudulent Promotion Reviews Exposed And Trip Advisor Acted!This is an edit, due to Trip Advisor's reply, which I thank them for, and their action, which was taken swiftly. So, let me explain:I had noticed, using Trip Advisor myself, that The Crown, Sheringham, Norfolk, had received a very obvious fake review, promoting it beyond what other reviews had stated. I, myself, know the pub, and reviewed it fairly as being far too expensive for the locality, and others have stated this on numerous occasions. This issue being it is owned by a large chain, in the UK, called Stonegate Group. All anyone has to do is look at the Stonegate Group web site, and find their pubs, and then just look on Trip Advisor to see if the place in question is one of theirs; the Crown is! This fraudulent review was left by someone called Nick H and he had clearly opened his Trip Advisor account in November 2022, and just for two, random reviews of non-hospitality. Then, after a dormant ew weeks he reviewed 20 pubs/bars and all of them were owned by Stonegate Group! The Crown, Sheringham, included! All of his fraudulent reviews were similar, with the Crown being, ''Amazing pub, great views, great food, great drinks deals. Staff always supper helpful. Always a five star experience''. This was what mad me suspicious! It is wrong! And it is clearly giving itself away with, 'great drinks deals', almost as if the reviewer were trying to appease the unhappy, who regularly complain about drinks prices! So, I then stated that Trip Advisor allow such misuse of their platform. And I now withdraw that. However, when I tried to review The Crown again, which I was entitled to do, as I had been back, and it had been within the time allowed, they blocked my review, because I exposed this Nick H and even listed all of his fake reviews! I thnk this is where Trip Advisor were wrong, as, had they been unsure about my words, all they had to do was write to me and ask for evidence. They didn't. Until I reported this review, and then had to report all 20 other reviews, too. I have to say, that Trip Advisor DID act swiftly, after reading my original review here, and they DID ask me for supporting evidence of the fraud, which I supplied easily; just by going on Stonegate's site, and making screen-shots of the 19 other establishments, to correspond with the fraudulent reviews. Nick H, probably Area Manager for East Anglia, and Stonegate, was dealt with; his reviews all deleted. I just hope he has been barred from Trip Advisor.Next, I went back to Trip Advisor as I had, some time back, noted another Nick doing the same thing. And, yes, I agree, how stupid can these people be, to use the same name?! But, it gets worse, as this Nick would state, for The Crown, for instance, ''Attended a training course for the nee Crown, and drinks and food amazing!'' Then, checking his 14 or so other reviews, they, too, were all for Stonegate Group, and he would go on to say, ''Working from this pub today, and have to say what fantastic prices!'' He would travel around the south of England, reviewing pubs owned by the company, pretending he just HAPPENED to be staying there or passing through! I provided evidence, again, for Trip Advisor, and today I noted both Nicks have been deleted, and all fake, fraudulent reviews they wrote on behalf of Stonegate, have been removed!So, Trip Advisor, well done, as I can see you DO take fraud seriously! I just hope you were able to do something to deter or punish the perpetrators of the reviews I discovered? I am sure they were written by the Area Managers of East Anglia and the south and south east of England, and this just shows the fraudulent activities of Stonegate. But, I have edited, as stated, to let people know that IF they get involved, and report fraud to Trip Advisor, in my experience, they WILL act, and deal with it!Date of experience: March 14, 2023\",\n",

Spoke to Swiss Port who I was told were our Tui contact not interested just laughing and joking talking to each other not interested in the several hundred people whose flights were delayed. Jet2 passengers were kept informed rep on hand talking to passengers. At 19:30 they were given a voucher for food and at 22:30 they were taken to hotels for the night. Our voucher came through at 22:00 after several people including myself contacted Tui to ask where our voucher was. Still not seeing a rep everyone now including children and disabled people left in limbo. Stuck inside the airport with only a coffee shop open. Locked in like prisoners. The planes could not land due to a haze and our plane was diverted to grand canaria. At 2:35 13.3.23 we met our rep Gillian Lawson who said she had been trying to get us all accommodation. We asked why she hadn’t been in the airport keeping us informed like the jet2 rep and was quite obnoxious and walked away. This is not how we should be treated. She told us that our flight will be 14:20 today but as on 3:55 we are still sitting here in the airport with no overnight accommodation only a seat. This is an appalling service to your customers. I know you cannot predict the weather but to have a rep turn up 9hrs 15 minutes later and tell us she’s trying to get accommodation is rubbish.  Why couldn’t we be put in the hotels that the people who were coming over on our flight were going too. There rooms are empty.Date of experience: March 12, 2023',\n",

       " {'reviews': 'TripAdvisor Is UselessTripAdvisor is a mess. I have a vegetarian restaurant in London, England, that feature on TripAdvisor. We rank very high in the guests review: for the past 3 years among the 100 best out of 15k+ restaurants in Greater London.  We still retain 5 stars rating after 3 years. Yet we never appear in any search for the best restaurants in our neighbourhood. Restaurants with much lower rank appears on the top 20.Why have a ranking system at all?!?To add insult to injury one of their salesperson calls me to try to convince me to pay for adds on their website. I complained restaurants with a lot of bad reviews and much lower ratings than mine appear above us. Aparently I would have to pay to feature in the Top 20. In other words, the Top 20 isn\\'t top 20 at all, they are just the business who paid TripAdvisor to be there?!?Another point:  when one searches for the best VEGETARIAN restaurants in... say... Shoreditch London, several steakhouses and others appear in the top of the list but no vegetarian restaurant anywhere to be seen in the first 2 pages. To put this straight, if you are a steakhouse, but serve tomato salad in between all the steaks, you can the  call yourself a \"vegetarian friendly\". Then you pay TripAdvisor to put you on the top. Someone searching for VEGETARIAN ONLY restaurants will see the steakhouse right on the top.  If this is not just wrong, I don\\'t know what wrong is anymore. Basically their search engine is useless, they have no categorisation for vegetarian or vegan and they want me to pay for adds to have my vegetarian restaurant to fight with steakhouses to be seen on a vegetarian list. This is madness!Must hurtful of all, it doesn\\'t matter how hard you work to get the best reviews, it counts for nothing. The big restaurants will pay TripAdvisor to be ahead of you on their messed up classification even if they mislead the public and serve low standard foods.For independent restaurants and most of all vegetarians, TripAdvisor is totally pointless.Date of experience: February 24, 2023',\n",

I thought they were a great company but thanks to Trustpilot I know I'm not the only one unhappy with their lack of customer care and service.This company is not easy to work with and they are dishonest about their policies. I tried to cancel my monthly subscription only to have it take follow up on my end and three weeks for them to tell me it's a year agreement. They couldn't show me where I signed up for a year and I have confirmed by trying to sign up under another company name that there is no mention of a year term. If you're trying to cancel, good luck with TripAdvisor as they offer little help to business owners who were led to believe there was a benefit to using them. Hopefully you have a good bank that has your back and can cancel the charges. I had a simple request, I'm new at this and I'm not sure what I'm getting for this recurring fee, and they couldn't explain that to me either. What I finally settled on was that the business phone number and website were allowed to be listed on their website for a fee and if my account rep had reached out to help me to set things up on the review side, I could have done it differently but I didn't know that was an option as there was no account manager or contact for anything other than payment forms. Got to love software that is happy to promise the world and take your money and then leave you to figure it out. I’ll take the blame for this as I am new to the game and kept paying the monthly fee because I was too busy to investigate it.Luckily for me, most of my guests prefer to use other places to read and leave reviews so I'll let them all know anything is better than TripAdvisor.When I heard back from normal customer service, and they couldn't help they had M.C., a Senior Customer Success Executive, reach out and he was helpful for two emails, then stopped responding. I reached back out, and he said he had been working on my case. Yet he still didn't have an answer for me, but they were still looking into it, but I couldn't cancel. He was very professional in his responses. I don't envy his job when he must make dog dukies look like prime rib with the unclear policies they have in place. My favorite was when I shocked him by asking to cancel because he had never ran into that situation in all his time working there.

I read reviews on those that are highly rated with a high number of reviews then make judgements based on good & bad commonalities of what the customers are saying about the operator.  I am a world traveler and I have not been stirred in the wrong direction by TripAdvisor.  All that has changed in my recent long trip to 3 continents.  I just got back today and decided to review TripAdvisor myself.  For the first time, I had 3 bad experiences with 3 tours listed on TA.  All of them were in the Middle East.  One was a no show. Two sent drivers who supposedly were also guides who did not speak English well and do not know much about the place at all. This made me wonder if TA is screening operators listed on their site.  I also found out that the operator I hired subcontracted it to another operator.  This happened a few times.  So the reviews I read and based my decisions on were not valid anymore.  It happened more than once.  When the operators came to pick us up, I asked for the name of the agency and it was different from what was listed on TripAdvisor/Viator that I contracted.  All 3 bad experiences happened in the Middle East.  Viator is owned by TripAdvisor too and they list the same operators in their respective websites.  These recent experiences put my high regard of TripAdvisor & Viator in question.  I am sad that I feel this way because I relied my judgements on their reputations too. My go-to travel site will not be my one stop shop for tours and tour operators resource any more.Date of experience: February 16, 2023',\n",

Be very very carefulSometime in the last few years TripAdvisor has gone from being an advisor to actually booking hotels/cruises/activities etc through its sister \\'bookings\\' company Viator.com, which TripAdvisor owns. This company is now very dangerous for travellers. Specifically because they do not properly verify the owner of the tour/activity/hotel etc they advertise and so anybody can list themselves as \\'XYZ Cruises, take your money and then do a bait and switch scam on you as you approach your booking dates. Let me give you an example. I booked a cruise in Asia, through the Tripadvisor site, thinking that I was booking it through the real owner of the cruise… I received a confirmation via Viator proporting to be from this Cruise Co.... i.e. the real company itself. Turns out I have booked it with Joe Blow Co. who is advertising that he is Cruise Co. owner. I paid the money in good faith (remember, I currently trust TripAdvisor) and then found out by pure luck that this Joe Blow Co was a fraud who took my money and would have 99% likely contacted me days before the tour date and deceitfully told me that \"unfortunately the cruise cannot run on your day so we have done our best and put you on a \\'similar\\' ship\", which of course would be substandard and much cheaper than the original cruise/tour/hotel/whatever and then he pockets the huge difference. In the end you get a substandard experience, and most likely leave a bad review for the real operator – who then has to wear that reputational damage.Why doesn\\'t TripAdvisor/Viator do something about this and verify its business operators properly??!!! You should also know that this was complained about nearly 10 years ago and they said that their \"engineers we\\'re working on a fix\"... It\\'s now 2022 and the Bait and Switch scam continues. I would recommend only booking through Expedia, Agoda, Booking.com etc and staying clear of booking through TripAdvisor.I used to trust TripAdvisor.

The tripadvisor representatives I have spoken with trying to track down this booking have been, at best, unhelpful. At worst, they have been downright mean. The last rep I talked to shouted at me and kept talking over me. When I asked to speak to a manager she refused to connect me. It was extremely frustrating. I ultimately made a dispute with the bank who was able to track down the source of the charge to my account. The charge was titled \"TA Plus\"... aka \"TripAdvisor Plus\". But Tripadvisor has no record of this booking. It\\'s with this 4th party booking agent. \"Perhaps you left the tripadvisor site and booked with a different party without realizing?\" Ok... I\\'m a reasonable person. We all make mistakes! Maybe I DID do that (but I\\'m still 100% I never left the main tripadvisor site) but this booking agent who has all of my information is just a middle man. You can\\'t actually book anything directly with them. They get info through booking sites and handle it on the back end. What has happened is Tripadvisor is passing some bookings through these sites to handle the booking load but these businesses are NOT trustworthy or dependable. They charged my account immediately but I was given no confirmation, the hotel had note of a request (so they definitely did attempt to book something) but the room type I booked wasn\\'t available and should never have been offered in the first place. It would have been one thing if I made a booking, they kicked it to another business to handle in that middle man role, and I still ended up with the trip I paid for. Instead, I have been charged $800 for something that no one seems to be able to confirm and it was done by a business that no one, even the bank, can contact. Why is tripadvisor doing business with these people? Why was I not warned that these people would be given my information and would be handling my booking? And at the end of the day, I can barely have a basic conversation with the people who are supposed to help me because clearly those jobs have been outsourced to a foreign country. I\\'m sure they\\'d be (mostly) helpful with tracking down a booking or making changes on their end with a booking that exists in their system. But with a complex problem they were absolutely worthless. I won\\'t be using tripadvisor in the future with anything other than maybe as a source for reviews. They used to be trustworthy. Clearly that is no longer the case. I would encourage everyone to use GREAT caution when booking directly through them because you never know who will end up with your information and, if there is a problem, they will not help you.Date of experience: September 30, 2022',\n",

As a result, I became upset when I realized why she was frazzled. Anger kicked in, and I posted an unflattering review of the company. Next, I wrote an admittedly nasty note to the CEO,  Matt Goldberg who has been there less than six months. My guess on his reading what I sent? Zero chance!Shocked - about five hours after my tirade, and on a Monday night around 8 pm, my wife got a call - from Matt Goldberg. Not an assistant. Not an imposter. The CEO!His approach could not have been more reflective of client centered strategic leadership. 1) Apology... agreed situation was not acceptable2) Empathy...  acknowledged her frustration was legitimate. 3) Asked Questions... assuring he understood - cared - and demonstrated respect.4) Restated His Understanding... which enhanced trust; really listening.5) Personal Promise... will be resolved within a day6) Request... if not resolved - call him personally!The next night, I shared with the MBA\\'s I teach (my retirement job) about our experience with Matt Goldberg. Rarely do I have an example of world class leadership. What I shared - lesson to consider:1) Personally Engaged... checking \"customer touchpoints\" - not just relying on what the executive team is sharing.2) Demonstrate Care And Respect... invest the time and effort in a manner that is desired for the entire company culture.3) Action Oriented... rolled up sleeves - and  get things done. Set an example for the team. \"This is what service is!\"Lesson Reinforced. All companies - and people - will make mistakes. It is how mistakes are handled that demonstrate their character and values. Surprisingly, some of the most loyal customers are actually the result of bad experiences - handled in a world class way.My guess? The future of TripAdvisor has never been brighter.

       " {'reviews': 'Bayshore vacation rental, Galvaston TXWe rented a unit in Galvaston TX at the Bayshore for 2 days. It’s a Victorian house remodeled into 3 vacation rentals. We rented unit 1. There were 8 of us celebrating my son retiring from the Air Force after 20 years. We had difficulty opening the front door. We entered the right number using the keypad but it took several times before we were finally able to get in. The pictures on the internet looked nice but when we got there we could see that the owner spent as little as possible renovating the house. The dining room floor had 2 really bad areas with severe termite damage. You had to be careful not to fall through the rotten wood. 3=of the dining chairs were unsafe to sit in because they were wobbly. The frying pans were disgusting that we had to go out and buy our own frying pans to cook dinner. There were no potholders or sponge to clean the counters. There was a mouse dropping on the stovetop and later in the evening we saw the resident mouse. It appears it is living behind the refrigerator. There is a mouse trap behind the refrigerator so we know the landlord knows about the mouse problem. The cleaning person sprayed oven cleaner all over the oven but only wiped the inside of the oven. The oven cleaner was dry and gross on the side and front of the oven door. There were termites in the dining area that we killed. There were cockroaches running around. The upstairs towel holder in the bathroom was pulling away from the wall. There were 2 coffeemakers but the 12 cup maker didn’t work so we were stuck making coffee in a 5 cup maker. They gave us 1 coffee filter with coffee for a 2 day stay. After seeing the mouse we passed on using their coffee and ended up going to the store to buy ground coffee and filters. The freezer had sand on the shelf. When you pay $500/night you expect better accommodations. We informed the owner and we were told to leave and we would be getting a refund in 15 business days. We sent photos to the booking site and before we got our things in the car they already had it listed again for sale. The house is not in a very “nice” area. The houses nearby and in the back are rundown looking. We hoped this would be a fun experience but it ended up being a nightmare. We ended up in Houston at the Green Tree Inn and it was so much better. I would have given Bayshore a negative star if I could.Date of experience: June 19, 2022',\n",

As a platform where reviews are very important you would expect that there are clear guidelines about writing and placing them. I got a negative review (which I don´t might as long as it is fair) from someone who made a reservation for a walking tour and the guide didn't show up. However I don't offer a walking tour. If you read the review it is clear it is not directed at my tour because the review states the name of the tour, the time it starts and the meetingplace. Which are all different from the tour I offer. So I asked Tripadvisor to remove the review. Tripadvisor sent me an email in which they told me they don't want to remove it. When I asked them why, they answered that the writer of the review had had contact with someone from my company. So I asked when that person had contact with someone from my business and they didn't answer the question. It looks like anyone can randomly review a tour without the need to really join the tour.

We got wet and then wet again, we had fun and laughs, we were well fed and everyone of us were completely impressed and a little in love with these guys.Date of experience: April 17, 2022',\n",

       " {'reviews': \"17 years a reviewer with no problem until last weekI have been writing reviews on Tripadvisor for 17 years and I never had a problem. Even when I had to write truthful negative reviews, the reviews stayed on the site, and sometimes I even received an apology from some restaurant/hotel owners who were honest enough to acknowledge some shortcomings in their services.Last week, someone asked for one of my restaurants' reviews to be removed and unfortunately, I did not check my mail promptly enough to ensure that the review stayed published.  I posted my own photos with the review to prove the truth of my statement, but this restaurant chain obviously cannot stand the truth about their subpar, extremely poor, and rude service.I have now reposted my review with photos and I am waiting for Tripadvisor's reaction. It's very unfortunate that it is impossible to contact Tripadvisor and be able to explain the situation and I think that their customer service should be reachable by reviewers. Otherwise, there is no point in allowing anybody to write reviews. Also, I would like to know who reported my 100% truthful review and I would not be surprised to know that it is someone linked to that wretched restaurant.PS Tripadvisor contacted me on April 7th and I read the mail only on April 11th, and I apologize about that but they should verify who flagged my honest review.Date of experience: April 11, 2022\",\n",

The building itself is very old and the neighborhood has homeless people hanging around. When we arrived, there was clearly someone not ready for us. There were clothes everywhere (including dirty panties in the room my children were supposed to stay in) The toilets were disgusting and there was a knife left out on the counter where my one-year-old could have reached it. I immediately reached out to the owner who was just as surprised by the condition of the apartment (they manage several so she had no idea which location I was referencing) She offered to refund my money for the inconvenience of being thousands of miles from home with nowhere for our family to stay, but we soon realized all hotels were booked due to the event happening at that time. We waited for about an hour before trying to call again for our refund (she never once answered my calls only text me back) to realize she had blocked mine and my husband's phone numbers. We immediately called TripAdvisor only to be told for the last 6 days that they are unable to refund our money because they cannot get in touch with the owner of the property listed on their website. We had to pay triple what we paid 3 months in advance for this property on a hotel in a different town and cut our trip a day shot to make up for the difference in price. A simple family vacation with our children turned into hour long waits on hold with TripAdvisor trying to get this situation resolved with no calls back though we were promised a follow up several times. At this time, we are still being told that even though we booked with TripAdvisor and had insurance to cover our trip they will not refund our money until the owner gives them permission to do so. All in all, this has been hands down the worst experience I have ever delt with while traveling using a company like TripAdvisor.

Easy to walk but very hot plus knee injury so had a buggy. But this was a people transport no way to secure clubs. So caddy held them on the back seat. A couple of holes cross the runway. I couldn't make full crossing so got a fantastic bounce off the runway ball went miles. Halfway house was interesting. Guys harvesting coconuts in next field. Sold to us. Only drink available. Beer at the end of the round overlooked a lake with crocodiles. Invited back at 6.pm.to see them feeding! Make sure to take passports as on military base. ID required.

What is your phone number? etc.  No responses.  Two weeks of questions, zero responses. Keep in mind, I live in the U.S.  I reached out to Tripadisor and asked for a refund.  They informed me there was no refund.  If I cancelled, I lost everything. They reached out to the owner and he responded.  We took the trip and all went well.Round two,  3 weeks ago I booked a condo in Miami.  The trip is this week.

I asked how the owner could cancel a booking but I was not allowed to do the same a few months earlier.  The answer?  The owner will be charged a cancellation fee.  I asked who gets that money?  We do, replied the Tripadvisor rep.  So let me get this straight, if I cancel I lose my entire payment, if the owner cancels they pay Tripadvisor a fee and I lose my booking and I am not compensated in any way?  His reply, that is correct sir. I understand your frustration but we will help you find another property.  They proceeded to send a group of properties that were several hundred dollars more for a 4 night stay, even a few one bedroom listings when we had booked a two bedroom property.  I have used them twice, each time was a bad experience.  If you are using Holiday Lettings, owned by Trip Advisor, proceed with extreme caution.Date of experience: February 21, 2022\",\n",

Also the room wasn’t even cleaned properly when we arrived (The bellhop told us we had to go downstairs again and get another room).

I believe that I have selected October 3rd, 2021 as the date for the tour. Together with my family I drove down to the Ken's Tour site for 5 hours. And when I got there it turned out that the booking was actually for the next day - October 4th, 2021. The Ken's Tour manager Zack Welch offered me the full refund, because the reservation was made less than 72 hour ago. However, when he saw that I had booked through the third party, he said to talk to them. Tripadvisor forwarded the case to Viator and they said that they need  the written consent by email from their supplier for the full refund. The Ken's Tour manager said that they will be looking for the email and will reply immediately. It turned out that they never received the email, because Tripadvisor's or Viator's supplier was not the Ken's Tour, but some other aggregator by the name Wannar Travel.So, in summary, Tripadvisor accepts payment online for the service they do not provide, Viator receives payment for the service they don't provide, Wannar Travel impose the policies for the service they don't provide and the tour operator that actually provides the service can't follow their own customer service agreements because booking has been done through a third party.The word of advise - you can use Tripadvisor for search, however, never pay through Tripadvisor but rather go directly to the actual service provider site and buy there.

Trip advisor is removing posts?I had left two negative reviews for The Atlantis \"resort\" in Reno Nevada, one concerning the hotel/spa and one for a restaurant in the building (which has it\\'s own independent Trip Advisor page). At the same time, I left two positive reviews for their main competitor down the street, the Peppermill Casino. Again one for the hotel/spa and another for a restaurant which is also in their building. A couple days later I get a notification that my negative reviews were removed, stating I am only allowed to leave one review per property, per visit, and only every three months. Obviously, the Atlantis complained to Trip Advisor, as my multiple positive reviews for Peppermill remain up. So this \\'multi review per visit\\' policy isn\\'t enforced equally.This leads me to believe Trip Advisor star ratings are definitely manipulated and not reflective of user\\'s actual experiences (unless they are positive of course). The inability to leave a review for restaurants and other amenities, which have their own independent Trip Advisor pages, is thoroughly dishonest. If I stay at a resort hotel for several days, and visit multiple restaurants, etc. I should be able to individually review any of their services which have their own pages. Why else would they have independent Trip Advisor presence?This manipulation of star ratings and feedback is dishonest, in my opinion.I posted about this in Trip Advisor\\'s forum. It generated a thoughtful discussion concerning Trip Advisor\\'s manipulation of star ratings for their paid / premium clients.

       " {'reviews': 'OUTBACK SPECTACULAR - a vacation of a lifetimeGloria and I have just spent six days in the Australian Outback hosted by “0utback Pioneer”, a family owned company with Richard Kinnon and his two sons Lane and Jeremy  What an experience we had!  We enjoyed the best of the attractions Longreach has to offer, such as The Cobb and Co Stagecoach ride, visited Nogo Station where we saw a champion sheep shearer at work, a Sunset cruise on the Paddle-wheeler along the Thompson River, a trip to Winton taking in the Australian age of Dinosaurs Museum, and the Stockman’s Hall of Fame was something to see, plus so much more!  The natural wonders and life on the land both past and present immerses you in the essence of outback life. We stayed at the Outback Pioneer in the Staging Post, a boutique heritage- themed accommodation, inspired by the style of the pioneer era! Our host Richard and the “Outback Pioneer” staff,  Maria and Miss Lovely (Wilma) together with his two sons, Lane and Jeremy made our stay most enjoyable. Plenty of laughter, jokes, stories, poetry and good food. A wonderful time had by all. Check out their website for all they have to offer.Date of experience: July 22, 2021',\n",

It is beautiful in every season . Our Hotel in Pahalgam & Gulmarg- Kolahoi Greens was suggested to us by a dear friend & we had the most  awesome stay with them . Our stay at the Club Mahindra Houseboat in Srinagar was another amazing experience. The stay at the houseboat was both luxurious & comfortable .

Later we went to a \"sacred cave\" where we saw a lot of garbage everywhere.There was no ceremony, nothing. When we asked why there is no ceremony then they told that they can prepare it in 1 hour. The ceremony would take another hour or more. We had only 2 hours because of other programs and as we lost 40 minutes first because of the delay and when we arrived to the \"sacred place\" we almost spent 2 hours already (as it was in the description for this trip and we made our schedule based on it). To be honest I wouldn\\'t make a sacred ceremony in the middle of a garbage dump.

Lots of the rooms have partial or full sea views. No complaints about the food buffet style served by the staff using distancing. The hotel is spotlessly clean everywhere, room maids cleaning constantly. Big bright bedrooms and balconies. Nothing was Too much trouble for the staff from the reception to the bar, always pleasant and smiling. Thanks to everyone for making our holiday special.

       " {'reviews': 'Tripadvisor censors certain reviews and a company\\'s average rating can be biasedI accuse Tripadvisor of removing reviews without contacting the person who posted the review to verify its veracity (i have evidences). This has happened to me often (recently on the airline Transavia for proven facts). I painfully remember a terrible hotel in Costa Rica, rated 4.5 / 5 so supposed to be excellent and in no way did this establishment deserve this rating. I posted a review after this bad experience and Tripadvisor deleted it several times because I was reposting. It must be said that this hotel was bookable on Tripadvisor. My opinion is that Tripadvisor ratings for an establishment or a company are unreliable because by keeping positive reviews and deleting negative reviews, mathematically the rating of a restaurant or hotel goes towards a 5 / 5 for all establishments, so for those who deserve this rating for the quality of their service, and for the bad ones who manage to remove negative ratings. It should also be remembered that the same person can create 10 emails and post 10 notices for the same company since there is no identity check, nor verification that the person has used the service. As proof, jokers have managed to create fake restaurants when they did not exist and this proves that Tripadvisor does not check anything and the worst is that these fake restaurants have obtained customer reviews !. I therefore have no confidence in the ratings given by Tripadvisor to companies. I think that some companies have privileged access to Tripadvisor and manage to obtain the removal of negative reviews, whether they have a \"marketing\" contract with them or whether they offer their hotel for booking (so clearly a conflictof interests) on Tripadvisor or simply that they threaten Tripadvisor with legal action. I reposted the review on Transavia which is factual on Tripadvisor, and if they remove it again, I go to the competition department of Europe. Because there is a distortion of competition when the negative ratings of a bad company are removed and that company is rated as well as a company which is excellent for the quality of its services. I pay tribute to Trustpilot which does not remove reviews like Tripadvisor censors certain reviews without any contact to verify the facts, and a company\\'s average rating can be biased and may not represent a company\\'s true worth.Date of experience: August 01, 2020',\n",

Because of it being a long day, what with the drive from Dorset and completing my business, I decided that it would be best to stay in an Hotel for the night. We stayed in the Best western Hotel Hatfield. we, actually, stayed at The lodge, which is across the road from the main Hotel. This was because we wanted a Twin room and there are none in the main Hotel. Well, I have stayed there before, in the main Hotel, but never in The Lodge, so i didn't know what to expect.But WHAT a pleasant surprise. The Room, with the two single Bed's in, was very spacious and the Bed's were very comfortable. And the Room was very clean and tidy. The bathroom was also very clean, and tidy, and the Shower was just right. after such a long journey we both had showers and dressed for our evening Meal, which was across at the main Hotel Restaurant. That's when it went a bit wrong, I'm afraid.We both had starters, a Prawn Cocktail each ,which were generous portions and VERY nice. For our main course: my Son ordered Hunters Chicken and I ordered Battered Cod. Mine was delicious, and a generous size, about the best Fish that I have had for a very long time I MUST say. And I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. But my son couldn't eat his he was put off by how it was piled up and he didnt like the taste of it. So, he told the Waitress and She knocked it off the bill and provided Him with a drink courtesy of the Hotel and expressed Her apologies to my Son for the meal not being up to the standard that he expected. That was the ONLY blot on our stay at The Best Western Hotel Hatfield. Because everything else was superb. The Hotel has a nice Bar and ,next morning, when we had Breakfast, we were served in a very friendly manner and the Breakfast was lovely.

As stated, my issue isn't with the owner, who when we discussed me wanting to cancel the trip due to Covid-19, explained that they were following Trip Advisors policy in not refunding the deposit. They would obviously lose money if they deviated from it and I wouldn't expect them to be out of pocket. My issue is with Trip Advisor who feels that the danger of Covid-19 stops on 31st July. Convenient, as I imagine most of their bookings are in August.

Only if you enter the exact name of the restaurant, does it show up. One out of 10 examples in Bardolino is Restaurant Caprice in Via Goffredo Mameli 3, 37011 Bardolino, Province of Verona, Italy. Try zooming in on the map - not there.

You are not aware of who is providing the tour until you book with Viator.  Ibermundo travel changed the dates of the original tour and refused to send the correct itinerary until 15 days prior to the tour date which resulted in requiring us to change our flights.  We contacted Viator regarding these changes and the only customer support we received was them forwarding unreadable e-mails from Ibermundo Travel.  The most we could get from the e-mails were that Ibermundo Travel was increasing the costs by 20% and everything we did in Egypt had to be scheduled and booked through Ibermundo Travel at an unreasonable price.  When we once again contacted Viator about the continuing issues we were notified that Viator is not liable for any actions of the independent tour companies.  We were informed that Viator acts as an agent for the supplier and not the consumer.  In addition, such actions do not in any way constitute Viator's sponsorship or approval of such Suppliers, or any affiliation between Viator and any Supplier.

Funny enough when we booked, the money came out of the bank the following day! We had to compromise on few things and the holiday costed more money. When I received the deposit refund back, it was £60 less. I know that doesn't sound like a lot of money but £60 is £60 after all. But it's the principle.

The entertainment when i was there was ran by a young lady called Bebe for short she was very enthusistic and terrific fun and we enjoyed activites such ss killer pool,killer darts,archery boucha (French Bowls) and Scholen and at night this was replaced by bingo and kareoke in the bar.Another great asset they have was Libby behind the bar a Welsh girl who was helpful enthusiastic and fun at all times smiling from ear too ear.In short a terrific place exceptional staff, they have large ( a bit dated rooms) but clean and were cleaned everyday good bars a large range of food and drink and entertainment.The hotel hosts guests from all over so as well as British theres German Russian Spainish and French infact from all over so if this is a problem for you think seriously as the British in this hotel are not the majority saying that everyone got on almost like a Large family.To some it up a great 2 star hotel i think should be at least 3stars and fantastic value for money.Date of experience: February 21, 2020',\n",

While I understand the need for companies to earn revenue, this 'need' for monetization has impaired the usefulness of TripAdvisor.  At one time, when researching 'things to do', the results were presented by traveler rating, providing a fairly unbiased ranking of the options. Today they are listed and ranked firstly by all of the options that can be booked through TripAdvisor and Viator.  You've monetized the ranking process, putting your corporate revenue goals ahead of providing unbiased traveler rankings.  Your Viator options appear ahead of all other options, pushing other options out of the picture.  As a result, I now canvass other sources to help me learn about and experience destinations, and I consciously avoid booking through TA.  I've also dramatically cut back on the number of TA reviews I post, which is a shame since I am a very frequent international traveler. It's also a shame, because what was a wonderful, unbiased resource has morphed into a process where users are funneled into Viator for revenue purposes.Date of experience: February 04, 2020\",\n",
